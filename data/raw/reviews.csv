the staff are amazing , from dealing with them before our visit and during our stay both hotel staff and the lads on the golf course were fantastic.. they could not have been more professional or kind. the only complaint i have is that i was not aware that i was staying in a room not in the hotel itself. maybe it was my fault and didn't see that when booking . it was not in walking distance to hotel due to rain but the hotel staff were always on hand to collect us at any time .|4.5|2021-10-17 02:00:00

the ambience is good and i think its a good dinner option for those who are visiting the hotel from out of town. the service was okay as the waiter was a little pushy. the food was okay but not for the price. would i recommended this place? yes if you are staying at the hotel. the bar tender was really nice and it has an outlet at the tables for to keep your phone or laptop charged for business or personal purposes|3.0|2021-10-31 09:48:00

location is amazing, you're a 5 minute walk from the national park, great for outdoor activities. room was very big, for some reason i got a room with a double bed and a single bed too. staff that had been there a while were great, very lovely, especially sharon in the bar, saoirse and ozzy in the restaurant. as with all hotels nowadays, they seemed to be understaffed a bit, my room wasn't ready after 2pm when i was supposed to check in, it took another hour and a half. the restaurant had to be pre-booked and i didn't get that communication unfortunately so it was booked 2 out of the 3 night i stayed.|4.0|2021-06-18 02:00:00

the evening was very good up to the point where someone or something dropped water on our table from floors above the restaurant. when we brought it to the attention of the staff all they did was say they would inform the hotel. there did not seem to be any real concern for our group having the water dropped on them. it did put a big damper on an otherwise good meal.|3.0|2022-02-07 06:13:00

i've been here quite a few times now, maybe 5-7 times over the past couple of years, i'm local. i know going into here the service is not good, but i usually go for the ambiance and nice view. last night was pretty bad though. we were excited to go, celebrating an occasion. 20 minutes to be greeted at our table, that's being generous, not exaggerating. server had his mask below his mouth the whole time leaning into to talk to us, drinks were brought after our food dropped. there was a super loud, messy party next to us but that was a first, i usually like the ambiance. they forgot our fries but they comped that. still frustrating. receipt was dropped off as we're finishing our food and we were told thank u for coming before ever being asked if we'd like a 2nd drink, dessert.. it was disappointing. if i ever go back it's going to be on a dead day because every where else decent was booked..|2.0|2021-12-05 21:47:00

"the experience was okay. the pre-dinner drinks at the bar were superb and the staff friendly and helpful. we really, really wanted to love the food
the appetizers we had were very nice - pimento cheese arancini with a green tomato chutney. i had the quail. it was served with greens and potatoes.
while the flavor and preparation of the quail was wonderful, my potatoes and greens were not hot. and not just luke warm, but room temp. it just really took away from the point of having a warm comfort food experience to be served mains that just were not warm. and while the flavor was fine, i can only imagine how much better this review and my experience would've been if my food had been hot when served.
the gravy was really flavorful, there just wasn't enough of it and it was placed on the fried quail which made the breading lose much of it's fried crunch goodness.
if i had received warm potatoes with a hot helping of the amazing gravy on them, this would be a much different review.
we had a flourless chocolate cake dessert, that was also served super cold as if it had just come from the walk in freezer (we couldn't get our spoons through it) and while it was tasty, it was only okay. we ordered coffee and it was also served at room temperature. not ideal on a cold winter night. the server apologized and took off the coffee from our bill, but that was just the final ehh in a meal i really wanted to love but walked away from feeling, well, e .
i will give this new restaurant another chance to win me over. as i said, i really, really wanted to love it. it is right in my neighborhood and has a cozy setting in a hip new boutique hotel lobby setting."|4.0|2022-01-11 17:55:00

went here right before 12pm check out for the hotel. they serve brunch on the weekends (i think) and lunch starting at 11pm for weekdays. i went on a monday morning with a friend and ordered the lobster roll and burger. the lobster roll was the chef's special for the day and i only ordered it because our server hyped it up. honestly it was at best 710 but because our server was awesome i'll give it at 8. it was good flavor, but not the traditional buttery taste. it tasted reminiscent of a bahn mi and even had shredded carrots on the top. the burger on the other hand was phenomenal. 910 i didn't give it a full 10 cause i only had a few bites so i can't say with confidence that it's a home run. but it was dank to say the absolute least. server + staff was awesome and i fck with the music they were playing. great rooftop spot for a small, up and coming hotel in dtla!|4.0|2021-06-29 22:00:00

the staff were very professional and friendly. the hotel is in a very location for the various excellent tourist attractions. the bedroom was fine but needs repairs. the phone in the room was broken and we had to disconnect it as it kept making noises. the taps in bathroom were also faulty. the biggest problem was that a wedding took place on the second night and the guests kept us awake most of the night by constantly slamming bedroom doors and screaming. not good when you have children trying to sleep never mind adults. couldn't ring down to reception as phone was broken.|3.0|2022-01-07 01:00:00

this hotel is such a mixed bag of opinions to be honest. gym is amazing pool is great hotel is clean. parking is good. it's a short 10 mins from the town but it lacks in variety of food choices especially if you have special dietary needs. they cater poorly for coeliac vegetarian or vegan guests. no effort was made to accommodate. service was very very slow. some of the staff are really good and others just don't have any initiative what so ever. tables were left uncleared for over a hour despite the amount of staff floating around. ordered drinks don't arrive. i understand teething issues for not being open for so long but at the same time guests are looking forward to a hotel experience and paying quite high prices for it, but the service and attention to detail just wasn't there. another issue being the over service of alcohol to already very drunk guests, room parties throughout the night and the walls are paper thin. it just wasn't what we had hoped for unfortunately. management was very customer focused when we voiced our complaints and also made every effort to make amense. the menu really needs to be looked at. restaurant and bar staff really need a crash course in customer service. ordered a jug of water for the table for breakfast and was handed a small glass that was half full. wasn't even a mouthfull of water.. i couldn't believe it. stayed in june 2021|2.0|2021-06-06 01:00:00

the location is like something from a movie, inside and out. it feels like more than a hotel. the bay view from the window was so beautiful to look at every morning. even the car park was beautiful! the whole grounds are immaculate. the spa and pool were so clean, the staff are friendly and patient. i even loved having a bath and shower in the room instead of just a bath with shower head. beautiful rooms, nice facilities, so bright and open. lovely atmosphere and ambience all around but especially in the restaurant saturday night as there was a man singing. that was just like a cherry on top as he sang one of our songs. food was delish and made to perfection, breakfast and dinner, which was great as my partner is a picky eater and he loved everything. we had such a relaxing time, it was just what we needed. i hope to return some time at all the only thing i could possibly change about our time in kinsale was when it came to dinner. when we checked in on friday the man behind the desk asked us would we like dinner on the following nights and we said yes. we confirmed a time between us and it seemed like he wrote that down. however on both nights when we went upstairs to the restaurant, there was no record of our booking. luckily there were a few free tables and there was space for us. to have it happen saturday and then again on the sunday night was a little frustrating but nothing to dampen the weekend. the food was out of this world! i also noticed a few of the staff, perhaps newer to the job, were not terribly familiar with the menu particularly when it came to drinks. no mistakes were made but at times they did not understand what we wanted to order and other staff stepped in to help. like i said, no mistakes were made but i was cautious of perhaps receiving the wrong order. i would also love maybe more variety when it comes to desserts as my partner could not have any of the options available but this was not a big deal|4.5|2022-02-15 01:00:00

unfortunately this place was one of the worst dining experiences i've had. the miramonte renovated and made a lot of really good design choices. in theory it has all the makings to succeed - beautiful olive trees with lanterns, live music, fire pits, modern decor - however at ever turn they got it wrong. i feel terrible giving a place a bad review because i always feel for the staff & i want businesses to succeed. there were only a few tables with patrons and everyone had the same gripes - ex i've been sitting here for 45 mins and haven't been able to get a drink or i've been here an hr with no food. all the patrons were commiserating about their unbelievably bad experiences whilst trying not to be jerks to the staff. two nice bus boys were apologizing profusely for the wait & all the issues. there was only one server i saw for the entire place & the hotel was sold put saturday for modernism week. you have to beg for every drink, fork & plate. not to mention the food isn't good. it's a strait up hot mess. this is a shame. it seems they are understaffed & the staff they do have isn't trained properly. hopefully this is a product of covid and the management of citrus & the miramonte can turn things around.|1.0|2022-02-20 08:24:00

the room was comfortable and clean. the property is comfortable and clean but the price was pretty much daylight robbery, and the location is not overly pleasant. i only booked it because most hotels were booked out and it's relatively close to the airport.. the restaurant manager was rude and rolled his eyes when i wanted to change tables to look out the window. from then on i just felt hostility from him. overall i thought the hotel was overpriced and very underwhelming. there was a trainee at reception i think her name was priscilla. she was excellent and couldn't do enough to help. apart from priscilla, the rest of the stay left a bad taste.|2.0|2022-08-23 02:00:00
this small restaurant, tucked into a quiet, airy hotel in the middle of waikiki, brought me back as a repeat customer today. despite a relatively simple menu, the gourmet level of artistry that these chefs deliver satisfies my every need for japanese cuisine. the deluxe sushi and sashimi plates, although pricy, are worth every dollar. the restaurant itself is small but quiet and provides a relatively intimate setting good for a small group of friends, or a date. make sure to ask if there is a special on sakes that night!|5.0|2021-11-08 04:31:00

my boyfriend and i stayed here for 2 nights for my friend's wedding. the staff were very friendly and helpful. check in and out was very quick and efficient. the waiters were very attentive too. we ate here many times during our stay and all breakfasts, lunches and dinners were perfect. the rooms were really lovely. we stayed in one of the suites on the second night and couldn't believe how luxurious it was for the money. i've often paid almost double the price for rooms in other hotels that weren't as nice. a huge room and bathroom with a separate sitting area, all spotlessly clean with lovely decor. llamas, sheep and goats on the hotel grounds were a very unique addition! i really enjoyed my stay overall, and would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a quick relaxing break away. i would have loved more vegetarian options on the menu. also, not the hotel's fault of course, but the overall surrounding areas have very little to see and do, so i would probably only stay here for a short break in future.|5.0|2022-02-15 01:00:00
olives at the virgin hotel did not disappoint- it was the highlight of our stay! we began with the wood grilled squid & octopus and a bronx bomber flat bread- to die for! our sommelier, bernard was exceptional and selected tattinger upon arrival for us. we selected pasta sampling's -tortelli feat. butternut squash which was incredible and the ravioli - the parmesan cream and herb ricotta made want to lick the plate! the vibe is jazzy and sexy and the service impeccable. we finished with white chocolate martinis. we can't wait to go back.|5.0|2021-12-31 22:22:00

not sure if this restaurant issues were truly related to covid as this was a constant reason why reservations were delayed in evening. this reservation was at 7pm but we didn't get seated until 7:45pm even though we had reserved. little did we know upon our first night eating here the dinner menu was the same each and every day. unless you have a car to leave hotel area there is nothing but this limited menu. there was issue with lighting as dragon restaurant had portable lighting brought into dining area and placed around but this didn't add much light but more of a dim romantic lighting with many families and their screaming tired children. as to ordering for the second night in a row and last, we had two birthday packages that were reserved two months in advanced for a chocolate cake and a vanilla cake (vanilla was needed due to food allergy). the chocolate cake was available but the vanilla was not, as the two prior nights the last vanilla was given out. there was an alternative cake provided, a vanilla cream, strawberry drizzle type something. it wasn't what was ordered but thank goodness the birthday child didn't complain and ate it. as we ordered dinner, there was a broccoli cheese soup offered and three of the party order this. later it was discovered they were out and offered a chili as a substitute. now, to remind some people that not all can eat meat due to tolerance of keeping any meat product down as these persons didn't order since they are vegetarian or vegan but seriously get sick when eating meat for protein. so we declined and knew it was not the staff working fault. what i didn't care for is the continuous nightmare excuse is due to covid. not acceptable, i work in a hospital and i want to use due to covid excuse. it's organizational workflows and informative customer service that keeps the public aware as they are informed what to expect. that's all it truly takes dragon restaurant management.|2.0|2021-10-06 22:28:00

"a total disaster. never seen so many confused people trying to run a restaurant.
it took us, a party of 4 to acknowledge the disaster of an evening unfolding before our eyes.
we first tried laughing off the awkwardness. simple requests such as turning gas light took 25 minutes to no avail.
asking for drinks to reset the night were not heeded.
we closed our eyes trying to understand if the twilight zone moment was for real and, well, yes it was.
last attempt was to call the management who listened to our 30 minutes of unresponsiveness.
staring at the floor, he said yes no problem, we will take care of it.
2 minutes later, after our waiter pacing back and forth 13 times, flipping his order taking notepad, we got up only to find manager making drinks for another table.
we got up, left, and skyward silence kicked until we walked into stk @ the w and tried drinking to forget this most underwhelming, psychologically overwhelming moment.
something is wrong. please assess and reassess customer service.
until never again"|1.0|2021-07-17 18:20:00

hotel location and parking is ideal. good choice of places to eat indoors and outdoors. the service was really poor which was disappointing. we got dinner and drinks on the friday, it took 15 minutes for our order to be taken which was fine. but nobody came near us once we got our food. we waited 25 minutes to order a drink after dinner, we had to approach staff 3 times. if we weren't staying in the hotel i wouldn't have minded but it was so irritating. especially considering we are in a pandemic and table service is essential we shouldn't have had to go up to the bar 3 times for a drink. we wanted to stay drinking outdoors after the second drink but we were facing yet another wait so we left and went elsewhere. on saturday evening we booked a table for 8.30 and were seated at 8.35, our order wasn't taken until 8.50 and the restaurant was relatively quiet. again we had the same issue of waiting to order dessert and a drink. after dinner the courtyard was jammed so we decided to stay indoors for one or two more drinks. we had to go up to the ridiculously busy residents bar twice to order where nobody was wearing masks. this should not have been the case and a lot of customers were extremely anxious over this. it was clear there was not half the amount of staff required on. the staff that were there were generally very good though, there were a few that were horrendous and seemed to avoid work or make themselves look busy yet did nothing. if the restaurant was busier and the courtyard also i'd have understood but there was a very workable ratio of staff to customers they just had no organisation of table rotation in place and the staff floating did not work off their initiative.|3.0|2021-06-14 02:00:00

i booked the hotel. your hotel charged guests personal cards instead of the card on file via booking.com. i called the hotel day before checkout and they said card was deducted already via booking. com not from guests card. which is not true. our travelers were charged their personal cards. this is unacceptable mess by the hotel and booking.com. we had 4 rooms there at the same time.|2.5|2022-05-07 02:00:00
"when we travel, we try to dine in small, locally-owned restaurants to get a real sense of the regioncommunity we are visiting. due to the pandemic, it's been a bit challenging getting into restaurants due to government mandates, so we've made reservations wherever we were able. last night (10421) we had reservations at huihui and quite frankly, weren't too sure what to expect from this hotel restaurant. wow! what a wonderful surprise! we were so very pleased with the lovely setting, amazing service, delicious food, and overall dining experience at huihui! when we arrived, we were immediately greeted by friendly hostess who sat us right away. i can't imagine there is a ""bad"" table in the restaurant..the views are stunning! our server, oliver, was very impressive: professional, knowledgable, and attentive. the food was island inspired, fresh, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. prices compared to other island restaurants was very reasonable. the entertainment was subtle and added to the overall ambiance and experience. and at the end of the meal, manager ronaldo, stopped by to ensure everything met with our satisfaction. okay..you get the picture here, it was hands down our favorite meal while on maui. in fact, we hope to squeeze in one more visit before we leave."|5.0|2021-10-06 03:20:00

"unfortunately we did not have a stellar experience at lunch. the menu is very small and what we did order was subpar. the rice of the bento box was undercooked and crunchy, the meat was over cooked despite requesting medium rare. the serving sizes are minuscule, even the french would balk.
service was rushed despite the restaurant being totally empty for the first 30 minutes of our visit. our server dropped the check with the first check in after dropping entrees, but stated ""no rush."" we absolutely felt rushed. it started badly by our server referring to us as ""hello gentlemen"" and did not apologize for his gaffe, just went on like nothing had happened. being mistaken for a man, then receiving subpar food and service made our experience mediocre at best. definitely not worth the prices we paid."|2.0|2022-01-15 05:07:00

great food and service but the live music was way too loud. it was almost impossible to hear the server or the people at my table. we would have stayed for desert, but it was just too loud. that high of a level of noise is not energetic, it's distracting and disruptive. live music at 6:00 on a friday in a relatively small dining area does not need a microphone and speakers. the prices are too high to end up feeling like you're in a bar. we probably won't return which is a shame cause the food was really good.|3.0|2021-12-18 12:01:00

"well, if you're going to bite the bullet and spend 200 on a meal for two, you should do it here.
since this place has been taken over [by people who clearly know - and love - what they're doing!], it's turned into a real gem.
a big birthday to celebrate, so we started with cocktails: smoked negroni was delicious, and the espresso martini - well, a 'patronnie' actually, with some tequilacoffee drink that's new to me - and is now firmly on my christmas list
the cauliflower popcorn here is narcotic, and not to be missed.
duck salad with watermelon was perfect, and my seared yellowfin tuna sashimi, the best i've had.
chicken milanese might be a simple dish, but it can be mediocre; this one was sublime. the duck leg i chose for my main was fabulous. we couldn't even finish the truffle and parmesan fries, let alone consider dessert.
two bottles of white wine, including the pecorino - so yes, we spent more than half on alcohol. happy, happy birthday boy. now we're booking for christmas week"|4.0|2021-10-07 04:47:00

"the ambience in the rooftop was great. a couple major issuesannoyedn1) if you don't order the $69 brunch pre-fix menu, not all menu options are available. i could not order an eggs benedict a-la-carte dish because items on the brunch pre-fix menu weren't orderable as stand alone dishes. imagine going to brunch, and not being able to order a benedict? laughable. i was visiting from vegas and arranged this brunch for a group of friends. it was embarrassing for me.
2) our waiter was fully aloof the entire time and seemed annoyed to have to serve us. wearing circular sunglasses and a man-bun, and listening to our confusion over the menu (i can't order eggs benedict??), he seemed annoyed at our questions over what was available. we also had to ask a busser to call our waiter back to handle a second round of drink orders because we were promptly neglected for 20+ minutes after our initial food order arrived. it felt like asking a favor to get service here. this particular waiter was far too cool for us, the brunch menu was hyper limited, so not returning to this venue."|2.0|2021-12-17 08:04:00
"the host was friendly she did not accommodate the special request that i had put in. that i had made reservations a week prior. we waited an extra 45 minutes to get seated. where she refused to put us at a special table that i asked for. only ending up to be sat there while that table wasn't occupied for the 45 minutes while we were waiting.the manager really wasn't on our side as well. but set us where i wanted us to be. the server was phenomenal he actually made up for the manager & the hostess mishap of treating us like regular awesome paying customers.
our server name was peter such a great genuine soul we wish him much success and we thank him for giving us a great experience at our first time at the establishment. overall we will not be back but the drinks were great and the breakfast burrito was awesome. we take serious percussion when we are treated when we walk into an establishment. we don't like to be miss treated or treated differently prior to others who are in the same space. who wants to have a phenomenal time."|3.0|2021-05-04 22:51:00

"overpriced restaurant that attempts to replicate a hotel afternoon tea service but falls short on all counts. rather disappointing overall.
we were celebrating our anniversary (as marked on our booking) but were seated at a table next to the till and the stairs to the toilets that felt very much in the gangway.
the tea service looked attractive but the quality of the items was just average.
the clotted cream seemed to be long life clotted cream that you can keep out of the fridge and had a very powdery texture. (surely rodda's can be afforded at 55 per head?) the crab puri, which should be crisp, was soggy and the scones were dry. the best item was the samosa. nothing else really stands out as exceptional.
we weren't offered any suggestions by the suited waiter when it came to teas and the same staff member seemingly had no idea what was in the vanilla orchid oolong flavoured tea i enquired about simply stating that he didn't drink tea himself but oolong is a lighter tea. i knew that much already.
i was expecting exceptional food and service but the petersham delivered neither. though the member of the waiting team that served us our complementary anniversary sorbet was by far the best staff member to serve us and almost single handedly rescued an otherwise poor service. i really can't find any reason to recommend this place. you could get a much better cream tea at a national trust cafe."|1.0|2021-08-09 18:13:00

modena never disappoints, in fact it just keeps getting better and better. i have dined here several times, and am always happier than the last time. the octopus, over the romesco with the vinaigrette was almost like butter, so incredibly tender. the artichoke hearts were so creamy on top of a bagna cauda that surpassed anything i'd had in rome. at petra's recommendation we shared a pasta. she said that the gnocchi were like pillows, she was not wrong! we added the perigord truffles, which took the dish to an entirely new level. we then had the pork cheeks which just about melted i'm my mouth, the cheesy polenta was devine. the brodetto was a perfect blend of rockfish, shrimp and calamari, the lobster broth was packed with flavors, perfectly portioned. the chocolate mouse was chocolate on top of chocolate, and then even more chocolate. the nikki laude is a truly smoked cocktail and the hotel cozumel was refreshing. the entire staff, from start to finish was super friendly and informative. i can't wait to come back!|5.0|2021-12-05 21:19:00

"overall, the food was very good. the calamari was plentiful and meaty, the fish & chips was ample, and the seafood fettuccini was good, but had too many capers in it for my taste and was sitting in a puddle of liquid butter. our waiter, ramon, was a little strange. when we first ordered, he ""wahooed"" when i stated my entree. although he kept checking on us, if we asked for anything, he would always say, ""i'll be back in a minute,"" but would disappear for quite awhile. i noticed him attending to other patrons and bringing back items to them, while he kept us waiting for simple things like water or a box or sauce. i've made a mental note to avoid this server in the future, since we frequent this restaurant."|4.0|2021-10-01 07:15:00

"location - the next great breakfast cafe is just around the corner, there a pubs and museums nearby. i had read a lot of the positive and negative comments before i booked our room and thought: alright, not too bad for 3 nights. i love staying in hostels, so i am used to the ""used look"". the stay was not a great experience though. in the end, we had a room across the busy casinostreet and the windows were hardly isolated ergo it practically made no difference if you had them closed or open -> three nights with earplugs. for two nights we thought our bathroom window was stuck (it was not, you just had to use a lot of force) so no ventilating in the bathroom for a couple of days. i asked one of the cleaning staff to take a look at it, i guess he did but then just went back to work lol the smell. this incredibly horrible smell. we are still not sure where it came from. it started in the hallway and got progressively got worse the closer we got to our room (in the room itself we could smell it faintly). was it a very cheap detergent that ""attacked"" our senses, i don't know but it i felt sick from it and my trav. partner was plain aggravated."|2.5|2022-10-12 02:00:00

me and my guy went here for a romantic dinner. we ordered the 48 ounce porterhouse, sauteed spinach, baked potato, and mac and cheese. everything was good except the mac and cheese so we sent it back. after being seated and served, my guy started not feeling too well. so we decided to pack our food up and finish it at our hotel. we asked the waiter to pack up our food however instead of packing it up, she ended up throwing it out! we spent a lot of money on our only few bites of dinner just for a careless waiter to throw our food out! i was so upset! the manager tried to accommodate us by telling us we had to wait 40-50 mins which we just couldn't do. he also told us that we couldn't be refunded any money which was odd to me because we used debit. he also, offered us an meal for our next visit however, we are on vacation and don't plan on coming back to new york anytime soon. so yeah they got their money and we left hungry. can't even give a real review on the quality or taste of the food because we didn't have much of it to get a good experience.|3.0|2021-08-08 09:57:00

honestly the service was absolutely horrible. extremely long wait times, our waitress took our drink orders - it took nearly 40 minutes for the drinks to arrive. nearly an hour after being seated we were finally able to wave her down to put in appetizer orders. we ended up waiting 1.5 hours after putting our apps to put in our entree orders. it was absolutely ridiculous and i will not be returning. a casual dinner ended up taking nearly 5 hours from arrival to departure.|1.0|2021-10-04 02:03:00

"we had a 6:15pm reservation and showed up right on time. we were seated at a communal tablewaiting area and told we'd be seated as soon as a table became available. after 20 minutes a waitress suggested we may want to order something as we may be waiting awhile so we ordered drinks and an appetizer. upon delivering the appetizer 10 minutes later the waitress asked if we wanted to order more food. we said no, we were waiting for our table. soon after the manager came over and explained that the restaurant was overbooked and we would not be getting a table. he offered to buy us each a drink for the inconvenience and poor communication. we accepted the offer, the drinks arrived, our waitress returned and we ordered our entrees. as we're waiting for our meals a hostess approaches us and tells us that the area in which we're sitting is reserved for a large party and we'll have to move to an even less desirable area when they arrive. our food finally arrived at 7:45pm (90 minutes after we arrived) and five minutes later the hostess returned telling us the party had arrived and we needed to move. i told her we'd move to an actual table or we'd finish our meals where we were. then she tried to tell us that we'd exceeded our ""90 minutes"" of table time as guaranteed by our reservation and i lost it a little bit. we had only been there for 90 minutes because we were waiting for the table which we never got! the hostess realized that we weren't moving so she suggested we could talk to the manager, but he never appeared. 5 minutes later the hostess returned and said she had indeed found a table for us! we picked up our plates and. .
the good: the view of downtown at sunset was beautiful. the cucumber martini was very good and the salmon entree was excellent. also, our waitress did her best to serve us and be supportive under conditions she didn't create.
the bad: the sashimi appetizer was bland and the bacon on my burger was so undercooked it was inedible."|2.0|2021-09-13 05:36:00

"a little disappointed with our visit today . where we sat was very cold and the fire was not lit until almost the end of our meal . i appreciate the door was kept open to ensure some airflow but the fire should have been lit prior to start of service .
the food was of a good standard but not really hot and the plates were cold which was a shame .
my husband had a pint of beer and after he had taken a few sips noticed the plastic pump nozzle was at the bottom of his glass . he took it back to the bar where the landlord just poured his remaining beer into a fresh glass and then topped it up . i think he should have been given a completely fresh drink and an apology.
we have eaten there in the past and had a better experience. sadly the pub did lack its warmth and ambience ."|3.0|2021-10-04 13:32:00

absolutely loved the food, especially the desserts that my wife and i gorged on over our two day stay. the entire staff was full of warmth and made us feel welcome at all point of time. it was also great that the hotel staff went really out of their way to arrange for cabs for us for travelling locally. the hotel was really neat and clean at every point of time and there was no disturbance of any kind. loved the swimming pool and jacuzzi. the restaurant was cosy and the recommendation by the staff on what to order was just perfect. kudos to the chef for such a wonderfully curated menu. at the risk of sounding picky, maybe the quality of fans for the rooms could have been better. at 200+ night, it was a little expensive on the pocket - but all in all it was a lovely 2 night stay and i look forward to be there again soon sometime.|5.0|2021-07-23 02:00:00

the room was terribly and insufferably warm. the radiator was turned up full blast and no matter how much i tried to turn it off, it wouldn't. i couldn't sleep at all, i felt like i was in a sauna. i had to open the window and lie on the floor using the duvet as a mattress to try and cool down. this is ridiculous because i live in milan and during the summer, it's more comfortable. this is the month of january and i have never been so warm. i had to catch a flight very early for essential work and i was completely and utterly exhausted because i did not get a good night sleep. nice staff. stayed in january 2021|1.5|2021-01-11 00:00:00

"met up with friends as a convenient place with both having about a 30 - 40 minute journey, so handily situated not far from the m6. one couple from morecambe and the other from leyland.
out of sea bass but apparently the salmon which both ladies had was just as good and done in a similar way, chef went out of his way to make a gluten free sauce for my steak as i am a coeliac.
so they catered well for gluten free with no follow on issues.
all 4 meals were complimented.
decor is maybe a tad dated but still ok.

great location. decent breakfast, friendly and professional service. very clean, great job from the team, it almost makes you pass the old furniture and wall paint. the whole feel was dated.. we had a family room. dated room, bath tub with a fixed overhead shower, my son almost got a scalding from the temperature mixer control. the heating was fixed at 18 degrees, which is a bit low in my opinion for this time of the year. just 2 wall plug sockets, one of which was unusable because it didn't even manage to hold the phone charger in place. they provided a clothes iron and board, a very old hair dryer, tea and coffee assortment but no fridge. this felt odd for a 4 star hotel|3.0|2022-02-03 01:00:00

hi , we had a issue when we where paying for the room. i had originally booked a room and my debit card expired so the booking company contacted me by email and cancelled my room as the card wasn't valid and i didn't see my email. when i contacted the booking company they re booked my booking but it was over 300 extra this time unknown to me until my stay was over. i was really in happy at the time but the girl on the desk showed little or no support.|3.5|2021-10-23 02:00:00
location was great for what i needed it for, booked a standard room which should have come with a double bed. i had a room with 2 singles. i had to stay an extra 2 nights due to work issues. i asked at reception to do this for me. i was told to modify booking on my booking.com account. i did this but for some reason it didn't work. i went to reception to get this clarified. the receptionist again said i would have to go make a new booking on booking.com. she was standing in front of a computer and i had to ask her if she could just make the booking for my extra 2 nights while i was there. she did this reluctantly (or i thought she had) when checking out i was informed i had only been charged for the 1 night and not the 2 as requested so i had another 118 bill still to pay. i also had issues with room service being sent to another room and having to wait about an hour for my dinner. not a great experience but would have been far worse if i had paid for this trip out of my own pocket.|3.0|2022-02-06 01:00:00

the location is beautiful and the older building was inviting. once inside, we waited a few minutes to be greeted despite a few staff members noticing we were there. once greeted by the hostess, my husband and i were led to a table not more then two feet from the only table in the room while the other tables sat empty. after some hesitation which made us feel as though we were putting them out, we were shown to another table. throughout our meal, only one other table arrived. the menu was great and had a lot of unique dishes including many for vegetarians which is appreciated.
our first course was french onion soup which we agreed was very good. unfortunately, we were not even a quarter of the way through our soup when our meals were brought out and very awkwardly forced onto the table along with our soups rather then being taken back to the kitchen to be re-fired later when we were ready. on to dinner, my husband had a salmon which unfortunately was very dry with no sauce but a dry paste under it. i had opted for a cheese plate which had an excellent stilton and house made boursin, the other two cheeses however were tasteless and not enjoyed. this on top of the party of four shouting their way through the meal was enough. we normally order coffee and desert but were too disappointed to bother. i rarely leave a negative review but unfortunately, there wasn't much positive to say which is unfortunate and unusual for us. i was hoping for a hidden gem but found a restaurant i would not return to. also, new carpeting is sorely needed."|2.0|2021-10-26 18:51:00
"the food was good but the service was not 100% , the food was not hot and i was going to get someone to tell them but no one was around, so to be fair i ate it as if i had waited to speak to someone it would have been colder. i asked for the sauce to be on the side and it was on the plate mixed in with the food.
as said the food was nice but would have been a higher score if hotter. no one asked us how our meal was and we felt rushed. i had finished my dinner and my husband was still eating and my plate was taken and i was asked if i wanted a dessert.
i appreciate it was fathers day but it was later in the afternoon, and when we arrived we were told it was a restricted menu, which i understand. however the only roast was beef and yet there was chicken on the childrens menu. i did ask but was told no . it would have been nice to have seen this restricted menu on the website before we got there.
not sure if i would try it again on a normal day, but the first impression was not a good one"|2.0|2021-06-21 12:44:00

i'm writing this to be constructive, and i do not wish to make it public. we waited over 20 min. before we asked for a server. we were seated at a table for two that was up against a table for 6, and the room was noisy and packed. my shrimp cocktail was extremely dry, and our steamed clams were average at best. the wedge salad was good, but my n.y. strip was the worst, toughest steak i have ever had. my wife had a mushy broiled lobster table, and the drawn butter was thick, with huge chunks of garlic in it. we did not complain to our server, as it was not her fault, and once she was told she had our table, she was quick, personable, and the brightest spot of the whole evening. spending $300 on a meal, i expect the food to be outstanding, and the whole dining experience to be much better than your average applebees. i'm not a chef, so i don't have any suggestions about improving the meal. however, nobody should have to wait over 20-minutes to be served, and you should get rid of the little tables for two, as it makes you feel like you're being crammed into the room with a shoe horn. again, i hope this is helpful to you, and i wish you good luck in your new endeavor. marty kavanagh|1.0|2022-01-24 17:20:00

very minor detail but the bathroom extractor fan is rather noisy and does not cut out when the light is turned off so anyone like me who is a light sleeper would find that an annoyance. staff were so friendly and welcoming. they even took the care to remember my name which was really lovely. the food in the brasserie was delicious and very well priced, excellent portion sizes and a nice ambience to eat. breakfast was perfect with lovely views of the gardens. bathroom was spacious and very clean and the decor inside the rooms was modern and bright. it was lovely to read up on the history of the hotel through pictures on the walls and there were little messages of hope written on stones dotted around the hotel which was very sweet as well.|5.0|2021-10-28 02:00:00

we were really excited to go to lunch here with our reservation. we were unfortunately very disappointed in the services. although there were many window seats with great views available, we were sat in a corner seat without a view. my husband and i arrived and the seater acknowledged our food allergies upon arrival- excellent! we were seated and left with our menus for 6 minutes before greeted. we ordered our drinks. our server was not knowledgeable about our allergies or about our special occasion. our menus were folded and well used, printer paper menus. from there we were disappointed with the wait times and that the wait staff did not anticipate our needs. my husband's chicken was grossly overcooked. empty plates sat for many minutes. water was not proactively refilled. dessert was not proactively offered. our espresso was not good. it did not feel like a special dining experience at all and we joked we have had better experiences at the local dennys. this is a beautiful location but they treat dinners like a typical roadside diner. i would not recommend for special occasions.|2.0|2021-12-05 16:54:00

"what happened was my friends wanted more ambiance for dining than the restaurant offered, so decided we should go up to the rooftop barnightclub for lesser expensive dining that had candles and music. i myself thought it was too loud - and was a 'bar"" environment rather than fine dining, which the others preferred. at both places, bar and restaurant, the staff for superior. the food was good in the bar, but it was not what i hoped for as for setting. another time and plan i would love the rooftop bar, though! my friends were very well satisfied."|4.0|2021-12-19 02:13:00

the toro nigiri special was overpriced and very bland. didn't even taste that fresh, which is extra disappointing.

2) we all got rather chilly whilst eating, as the open fire was burning quite low. i guess it is tricky, as people sitting right next to one of the 2 fires can get too hot.
we also found that the barn was too cold for us whilst watching jim causley.

pros: excellent pay, benefits & employee meals. fairly good company culture and above average in terms of organizational efficiency in comparison with other hotel chains. cons:overall i think this is an excellent company to work for. the only con i could think of is that this company's culture can make service employees feel like second class citizens. service employees are forbidden from using any of the hotel's amenities even on their days off (at least in theory); while managers and corporate employees can even get wasted at the hotel they work at and have no consequences. treat all employees the same|5.0|2022-12-07 22:45:00

staff very friendly and nice atmosphere in the pub and grounds.
lots of dogs.
parking wasn't the best and we ended up some distance from the pub but others were luckier.

staff actually gave us on good place to eat after we expressed concerns about the overcrowded space ok the door didn't seem to fit as i could see the lights from the hallway which made we worried that the door wasn't a proper fire door. there was no soaps, nothing for the bath etc. went called down they were no help. when we handed back the swipes staff didn't ask us how our stay was etc we were also asked to pay upfront which is unusual. the room was pretty basic t.v was poor quality and the door jam into the bathroom was chipped and needed a paint. certainly not four star level.|1.5|2021-11-07 01:00:00

we decided to try something new for a milestone birthday. the rooftop restaurant is just a rooftop restaurant with no great view of the city. the service was just average with no special wow factor. we ordered the 10 course brunch which includes 3 specialty drinks included in the 10. there was no introduction to each meal but rather just put the item on the table and leave. the last drink was not available and we were offered a substitute because the frozen drink wasn't ready yet. to top off the meal we found a huge hair in our food. i don't think we will try this place again for a second chance. we will go to la live if we decide to go to la for our next celebratory dining.|3.0|2021-12-02 14:54:00

"my wife and i both had the large cut prime rib, and it was excellent; however, during the course of the meal we were told when we asked to have some more bread with our main course that the bread was complementary, that their standard practice was to charge for any additional requests for bread, but since we were (apparently) first time customers they would make an exception and would serve us the bread. i have never heard of or experienced a restaurant policy of charging
for a second portion of bread.
we were celebrating our 18th anniversary, wanted everything to be perfect, and all of a sudden there's a hostess at our table lecturing us on restaurant policy. it was frankly embarrassing. we ended up paying over $150 for dinner including tax & tips, and they're pimping on us over $2 worth of bread. my wife and i felt like we were being targeted, for reasons unknown. the hostess was not rude or hostile when explaining the issue with the bread, but she was very condescending.
i am very disappointed that the food at cedar creek was as good as it was while the service policy maintained was so miserly. i would be hard-pressed to ever consider returning to this restaurant or to recommend it to a friend."|2.0|2021-10-27 12:20:00

service was poor, they screwed up our reservation we'd make almost two weeks in advance so they didnt have enough tables for us. the hostess was incredibly rude about it and not at all apologetic. we ended up having to squeeze 6 people at a table of 4, she wasted 40 minutes of our reservation arguing with us about how we needed to just deal with it that she wasn't fixing it any better than that and then we still had to leave when the original reservation was over even though half the party was still eating since there was a delay. the food was just mediocre and very expensive. it was over $140 for two adults and two children to have chicken fingers and fries and wasn't super good. once party member ordered kd from the kids menu for their kids and it came like soup they took it back to replace and all they did was poor the liquid out of it, it was gross. the janitor closed the bathrooms half way through the line of people waiting to get in and half of our group got cut off from going to the bathroom with their children so she could clean it. rather than letting them finish the line of people she closed it so she didn't have to wait she was incredibly rude about it and would not keep it open so the line of people could finish. it wasn't a great expereicnve all around|1.0|2022-02-21 17:23:00

enjoyed returning to this lovely pub. the ambience is perfect - a great mixture of interesting food, good service and old pub atmophere. the paella and dessert was outstandingand the only reason for not giving the food 5 stars was that my husband found the thai chicken rather tough. we did mention it to the staff, but no allowance was made. however, would definitely return as feel that this was unusual|4.0|2021-06-18 15:58:00

as much as i looked forward to experiencing this place, it was a strong disappointment. we didn't even see our waitress other than when taking our initial order. after waiting for over 30 mins for my soup and my friends salad, my soup was brought out cold and my friends salad was wilted and flavorless. it was terrible. i'm not one to write such a review, but would hate for anyone to spend the amount of money we spent for such service and quality.|1.0|2022-02-15 18:10:00

"the entire ""sugar factory"" atmosphere has been removed. there is no longer a candy store or souvenir sales. all the photos on the website no longer exist in person in the restaurant. the lobby is completely empty, looks like a conference room at a cheap hotel. customer service was terrible. my reservation was for 6pm, i called at 5:59pm to say i was 2 blocks away due to heavy traffic and was told if i'm 15 min late my table would be given away. my party of 8 got out and walked the remaining 2 blocks and arrived at 6:07pm where we were told it would be a 45 minute wait. we decided to take our business elsewhere and as we walked by the restaurant side, which was very loud, sure enough there was a completely empty table set for 8."|1.0|2022-01-25 15:51:00

too expensive for what it's worth. service and ambiance was nice. the event itself is a little misleading on the details of the menu. once you book, you can't find the spooky tea event on the website just unclear and confusing. think i had found it through timeout la. not a real high tea, more sweets than salty sandwiches, and disappointingly, not even a signature cucumber, dill sandwich that high teas are know for. we left hungry!|3.0|2021-10-10 21:44:00

one of the key dishes on the menu is the hainan chicken and it would be interesting to know how this is prepared, as this came over to the table very quickly after ordering.
however, concern was raised to the staff and a new dish was prepared and all rectified with a comp drink as service recovery."|4.0|2021-10-03 10:46:00

"made a reservation for yesterday, my birthday. i arrived and the two people in the front greeted us but were confused on where they could sit my family and i. we had to wait 15 minutes while they were situating themselves to see what table was for us. i made reservations a week prior to my birthday to get a good table. but, unfortunately we were sat all the way to the back with no view. very unfortunate since this restaurant we ""pay for the views and pictures"" the only view was of the heater burning up the fake green leaves on the ceiling. which had a horrible smell. {smelling burning plastic can cause death}. i also made sure to state my birthday was today on the reservation and i didn't feel any celebration they didn't do anything to celebrate my birthday. extremely disappointed and would not recommend this restaurant for any special occasion or coming here to eat. also, the food let's not talk about it. for the price we pay it could be better. our waiters were very kind, helpful and attentive!! thank you but other than that horrible experience"|1.0|2021-09-24 20:20:00

"the food was okay, but definitely not worth the price. it didn't meet the expectations set by the website.
rare steak came out blue and was cold, and the 'claret just was actually gravy.
the whole place had a weird vibe, barely anyone was there so everyone was talking very quietly - which meant there was no atmosphere. some music playing but it did not suit the setting at all.
the waiting staff spoke so quietly and had a strange approach, almost like they were nervous & not switched on.
the room itself was also very cold so i ate the whole meal with a scarf on which wasn't ideal.
wouldn't recommend."|2.0|2022-01-30 12:14:00

i was unable to call property as the number to hotel was taking me through lots of connections, i was tired and cold, stood at the airport border for an hour, so could not think about emailing hotel reception, in effect the hotel main doors were closed, i did knock and was not heard by receptionist, took me time walking around and looking for other entry, to realise that there was a door bell, but not very well visible and sign posted, lights are not very good at the main entry to the hotel. porter said he did not hear my knocking and i should use more power to knock. when i have got the key to room 330, i had to fight with room doors and after several attempts doors finally did open. i was very upset and disappointed with quality of this service, bathroom bath tube has been rusted to the sides of the walls and in the middle of this the white enamel chipping off in few places, of the bath tube. room was a bit cool for me. double bed, hot water in the shower, toiletries, clean and tidy, superior room, quiet room, tea and coffee, hare dryer, iron, stayed in february 2021|3.0|2021-02-01 06:00:00

we have eaten at seven many times, but this took the cake! we had a rez, and we stood in the doorway for 10-15 mins. 3 people noticed us, but didnt say a word to us or cast us a smile. we moved into the bar area, where the workers tend to congregate. still nothing! finally, a barmaid was getting a drink for someone and i asked where to checkin. told her we had res. she said we dont have a table for 3. we were mad and ready to leave, when another woman showed up and sat us across the hall from the place, in a mostly unused room. one other couple was there, and we felt strange, but we stayed. the food was mediocre, as expected, and it took us more than 45 mins. to get food.|2.0|2021-11-22 14:42:00

i had lunch with my son here while we were on campus for a high school competition. great decision to go here! everything was amazing! i added a fried egg and bacon to my burger, and it had every texture and flavor i could ever want. the fries were hot and crispy. the heirloom carrots were out of this world! i have never before tasted cooked carrots that i liked until i had this appetizer. the zero proof pineapple ginger drinks were refreshing and were served in really cute metal cups. the waitress was attentive and efficient. the atmosphere is calm and classy. i can't say enough about how excellent this dining experience was!! i'd be back again tomorrow if i didn't live 3 hours away smile|5.0|2021-12-13 20:46:00

we travelled the west coast for our summer holidays. this hotel was the best one we stayed at, despite other hotels technically having a high star rating. the rooms where clean, comfortable and cool. (during the heatwave) the staff where very friendly, nothing we asked of was a problem. we used this as a base to travel to the aran islands, and the fantastic beaches co clare has to offer. our son loved the kid's movie nights and even ate his dinner in front of the big screen, & our teenage daughter loved the mocktails! the hotel itself was recently decorated and was easy on the eye. lots of little comfortable seating areas to sit down and relax. the management & staff have made a great effort to make this hotel feel like a welcoming space to be. not that we didn't like so much - and definitely not a deal breaker - but our window in the room didn't work properly & the adjoining door to the interconnecting room needs a dose of wd40 smile just clutching at straws here.|5.0|2021-08-21 02:00:00

"we went for a valentine's day lunch as advertised: four courses including a before meal glass of bubbly and a bottle of wine with the meal- for $150 for two!! terrific, right? the only reservation left was 2:30 so we took it.
i have to say we love the restaurant , and will return at least twice a month.
well, they were sold out of the items on the special. and, the restaurant was closing at 3:30. we had a marvelous meal, but were unable to have coffee with our dessert as the capuchino machine had been cleaned.
in the future when we go to marco polo for a late lunch or a holiday special meal we'll call to check directly with staff about the timing and the availability of the special. the online reservation process did not work for us this time.

they weren't very busy - maybe 5 tables max so i wish they would've given full drink and food descriptions when dropping food - including sourcing.
they only touched the table to drop or clear - which is fine. the drinks were very stiff and overly exaggerated in description with little no other notes.
wouldn't recommend this restaurant."|2.0|2021-11-28 14:34:00

"we had a reservation for 9:30. when we arrived, the host told us that the kitchen would be closing, so we should order quickly. i can't help but wonder why you would take a reservation for 9:30, if you don't want people to come and enjoy their dinner? it put a bit of a damper on our meal.
our server was amazing. he was attentive and helpful. my rating of 35 stars comes mainly from the appetizers.
we were starving when we arrived, so we ordered 3. the scallops were delicious, but there were only 2 of them and the chorizo they came with was just ok. we definitely didn't feel that we got value for our money with that dish. the potato rolls were delicious when you ate them together with the mushrooms and the haskap sauce. however, the filling was chalky and the first bite was a little off-putting. once i got past the texture, i enjoyed them. finally, we ordered the carpaccio. when we finished this dish, i tod my husband i felt confused. it didn't really taste like anything, and i wasn't sure how you were supposed to eat it. we ended up scooping it onto the provided chips. i would not order it again. at the end of 3 appetizers we were still starving and were planning where we would stop for food on the way to the hotel if the mains were similar.
our mains were delicious and a great size. i had the mussels, and my husband had the trout. both were superb.
every dish we ordered was buried under a handful of baby or micro-greens. i didn't feel they added anything to the flavour of the dishes, and since each dish was covered, it didn't help the presentation.
we will not return. there are better meals out there."|3.0|2022-04-02 20:26:00

"while the vegetable and meat selections are acceptable (thanks for adding on tofu and sausages to the selection). what makes this experience disappointing is the broth and appetizers. all the broths have very little flavor and the dipping sauces don't make up for it. the appetizers were cold, stale, and not very tasty. sushi selection is minimal nothing to be impressed over. desserts did not have any visual appeal (maybe just the cotton candy) and they had a breadbakery selection that looked worse than your standard motel continental breakfast.
when i compare this restaurant to alternative all-you-can eat chinese hot pot restaurants, i just don't see how they can compete in the meatbrothsauce category since chinese hot pot beats this restaurant by miles in flavor and in price.
the only area where this restaurant can shine is in the appetizersdesserts, which i have mentioned is severely lackluster. i guess you get the robot that delivers your meat? that's pretty cool. you get your own individual hotpot? i guess if you don't like sharing, but you can't bring more than 3 guests because aren't set up for it.
i just don't see this restaurant saying in business for long with a $37 price point when there are like so many tastier all you can eat options within a 15 min drive."|2.0|2021-09-24 18:19:00

"top notch! my husband and i saw this place driving and made a note to come back and try it. we decided to have date night here and it did not disappoint. the valet parking was full or something at the omni but we found street parking next to scissor tail park.
we walked in a little before our 5:30 reservation time and we were promptly greeted and seated. a waiter came and brought water and bread. our server then came and dropped off the veggies before the meal. brined cucumbers and red bell peppers. different but so good!
our server jordan then came and took my drink order. i needed to substitute the grapefruit bitters but it was no problem and the drink was awesome. i ordered the 14oz rib eye with smashed potatoes and my husband ordered the tomahawk chops with smashed potatoes.
my rib eye was the best one i've ever had. i enjoy steakhouses and we go to an expensive one at least 2x's a year. this was hands down the best one. it was tender but crunchy and melted in my mouth. my husband loved his chops (it said t reminded him of the flintstones) and the random carrot. the applesauce was also really good.
jordan was attentive, the ambience was nice and it was a great date night dinner. the tool used to clean up the breadcrumbs was cool and having our eating utensils switched out before the meal was an extra step that was appreciated."|5.0|2021-11-14 02:34:00

"great place for locals and visitors alike.
good carvery but it was missing the pigs in blankets yes i dont care its not xmas yet thats what i like , great service from polite & friendly staff and most importantly - no hospital masks ! so we can have service with a smile, eat our food and not feel like we are going for some sort of medical procedure like we did at watergate bay hotel last weekend which looked like an operating theatre full of faceless mask zombies.
usually carvery is quite dry and not nice but they have done a good job here not over cooked it, get in early because there was a que of people around the pub - a que of nice people btw, good crowd here and no issues with our two kids who are extremely badly behaved unf.
we are local, great to see a nice local place - see you again soon and thank you"|5.0|2021-11-15 05:21:00

"our waitress was very friendly and helpful. after placing our order, we waited almost 50 minutes for our food, with no explanation or updates. thank goodness bread was provided. when the food arrived, the manager (i assume) apologized and said they had to remake our dinner as they made a mistake and had given our food to someone else. i wish they had let us know that when they realized their mistake instead of waiting until the food was ready. the steak tasted good; however the filet mignon i ordered was about 14"" thick which surprised me. the thinness of the steak resulted in it being overcooked. usually this cut is about an inch thick. the baked potato was lukewarm; i'm guessing they didn't reheat the potato when they recooked our order. they did give a free dessert for these issues."|3.0|2021-11-18 23:06:00

"sunday brunch in the outdoor patio restaurant is very pleasant. the food is good and relatively inexpensive. the brunch drinks are a good value also. we come to this hotel frequently and enjoy it, they work very hard to make it a great experience.
the fact that you have an amazing beach view while eating makes it all the better.
the service was just a tiny bit slow but the inside restaurant was packed and our server was working both, so it must have been difficult to keep up. it was o.k., we got to stay longer, so all good, right? i only mention because if you are in a rush to get somewhere else, this might not be a good choice. otherwise, relax and enjoy!"|4.0|2022-03-21 19:17:00

during our particular visit, the restaurant seemed understaffed for the amount of reservations and dining guests. we were met with a frantic host, who was rushing to accommodate reservations, with no help (i felt for the guy). when it was our turn to be seated, we were walked into a separate section of the restaurant into what seemed like the bar of a hotel lobby (called european bar); there we were met with a bartender that also seemed to be juggling and trying (but failing) to accommodate several drink orders and host individuals who were sitting in his area, all the while no music playing and you could overhear neighboring parties conversations, who were also taken aback with the sub par service that day. when our order was finally taken (we waited for 30 min) we were told the paella would take anywhere from 30-40 minutes to be made. we finally settled on two tapa plates and both were very good, but overall the experience was below satisfactory from start to finish.|1.0|2021-09-07 23:00:00

this is definitely the place to go if you want to get away from it all, the surrounding lakes and forest provide a feeling of seclusion. the castle itself is delightful, my favorite room was the one with the huge ornately carved fireplace. the afternoon tea was the best i've had anywhere, each portion was delicious and light so that it was a pleasure to eat the whole thing in one sitting, and the old fashioned we had with it were perfect. the food in the sandstone restaurant was everything i was hoping for. the staff a friendly and attentive without being intrusive. the staff really were the best part of the experience for me. the heating in the restaurant was up a bit high for me|4.5|2021-10-12 02:00:00

the choice of food at breakfast was nice. the view from my room was lovely and staff were very polite and welcoming. location close to the town is very good. room was very dated and the shower had not means to turn it on. the mattress was very uncomfortable (possibly broken or too worn). the buffet breakfast wasn't very warm at all (i went down at 8am)|2.0|2022-05-16 02:00:00

"the restaurant found at the end is very attractive outside nice view of the hudson river. beautiful architecture and grounds. the dining room where we sat was very dark. overall ambiance wasn't too appealing but we couldn't change to another area. would have preferred to eat in the patio that was very attractive. we ordered oysters, a branzino and arctic char.
we returned the oysters because they were not fresh. presentation on both entrees was very sad looking. we return the broccoli bob and ask for a new one. neither dish had much flavor to speak of.
unfortunately the staff attending to us were new and therefore we cannot be too hard on them. she did the best she could it was actually very attentive.
this was to be a special occasion for our wedding anniversary which we have a tradition of going to historic inns known for their food.
we missed the mark with the apropos restaurant. we have been doing this for 38 years. and the apropos will rank as one of the lowest not to be recommended as a go to place for fine dining.
it will do for any place where you want to pay more than you should and really don't care about what you eat or the overall experience."|2.0|2021-09-11 19:01:00
the restaurant was recommended by an employee of our hotel. it is open air seating, which would normally be great, but that night it was too cool and windy to eat outside. unfortunately, the entree i desired wasn't available, and the fresh catch was some scallop and lobster combo, which usually means nothing came in that morning. the mushroom risotto was an excellent substitute, however. very rich! my companion liked his paella also. our waiter, doug, did try to move the kitchen along, as we had read that they tend to be slow. the architecture of the restaurant, and the hotel in general, is stunning, so the ambienceexcept for the outdoor temperaturewas very pleasant.|3.0|2021-12-14 03:48:00
"we recently celebrated a family birthday here and everyone really enjoyed both the food and experience. plenty to choose from on the new menu and everything was clearly labelled for different dietary needs the waiter was efficient, friendly and helpful.

we ate at the lobby bar on two occasions. the first night we were desperate to find food after our reservation at havana bar and grill canceled two hours before we were supposed to eat there. after scrambling for several hours we found someone at the hotel (astrid) who tried to accommodate us as best as she could, and then annalise and chef louis went out of their way to help us as much as possible and give us a delicious meal, even though they were short staffed. we liked it so much that we went back, this time with a reservation. lupe was an excellent server, and we had a great meal. my biggest complaint about the food at the fairmont is that it is extremely overpriced.|4.0|2021-12-30 16:11:00

"terrible service. two entire pizzas (minus the couple of bites to try the food) were left uneaten as they were downright terrible. on top of no one coming back to the table or even willing to make eye contact for ~20 minutes (two instances of this), once i was able to flag someone down he seemed bothered i stopped to ask for my check. he was the two uneaten pizzas and asked if we wanted a boxto which i replied ""no thank you we did not like it"" he just said ok and walked away. eventually the actual server for our table came back and again asked if we needed boxes to which i again advised it was not good and we did not like it. ""alirght have an awesome night!"" i wasn't expecting to not have to pay for the food or anything like that, but i manage a customer service team and what i was offered was a complete lack of customer service. after this we cancelled the rest of our reservations for the restaurant for the remainder of the trip. we have and will use doordash while staying at the castle hotel."|1.0|2021-10-09 05:17:00

lovely place but food needs some work. beautiful dining room and first-class waiter, but two out of our four dishes were mediocre and two were good. scallops and caesar salad were very good. other salad was a rather bland giant bowl of lettuce--it would be good to have some more interesting alternatives. two of the medallions in the chicken entree were underdone, including completely raw in the center. even the properly done pieces were only ok in terms of the quality of the dish. the elegant location and high prices require that the food quality be stepped up.|4.0|2022-01-18 07:08:00

beautiful buildings in fantastic grounds. the castle is absolutely fabulous-i felt like i was in a period movie! bedrooms in the lodge were lovely with a very pleasant view. beds were very comfy. the local countryside of monaghan is gorgeous. the service was terrible from start to finish. slow and disorganized. the staff at the lodge were incredibly unhelpful-fairly standard requests couldn't be met (use of an iphone charger, use of an umbrella to run to the carpark and back). came back to my room to find cleaning staff gone and door wide open. we were double charged for drinks at the bar. the staff at breakfast were downright rude. check-in and out was chaotic. staff seemed to be a mix of the inexperienced and the indifferent.|3.0|2022-12-02 01:00:00

we are from minnesota and showed up hoping to get a table after searching for a farm to table restaurant in the area. the hostess was so welcoming and was able to accommodate us. our delight with this experience only went up from there: waitress emily gave us information about the history of rye tavern along with her attentive and excellent suggestions and service. the food was the very best in both quality and presentation (my kale and carrot salad was garnished with bright radish swirls). it was obvious to us that the chefs in the kitchen put great care into choice of ingredients and their preparation. the tavern goes back to before the days of john adams, when it was also an inn, and his high praise for the warmth, good food and character of the place registered with him. a couple of centuries later we echo those sentiments. thank you!|5.0|2021-09-28 12:09:00

the receptionist was lovely, very welcoming and friendly. they didnt notify us there was an extremely loud and busy nightclub downstairs that goes on until 3am until we actually arrived to the hotel, we think this is ridiculous as we had early mornings while there and it was extremely difficult to sleep. when we arrived back to the hotel at night there was a bouncer outside the entrance who was physically and verbally aggressive and just overall extremely unprofessional. we're a relatively young group which seemed to be a large part of his aggression and when he asked for our names to check their list he tried to tell us we all weren't on it even though we could clearly see it. when i gestured towards our names listed he screamed in my face and put his hands on me which was very unnecessary and very uncomfortable. appalling behaviour coupled with the noise and lack of cleanliness made for a nightmare hotel experience.|1.0|2022-12-21 01:00:00

"it was our second time going within two weeks and this time the service was way off, my wife's order was not placed and when waitress delivered the other three meals we thought hers would be coming in a minute. about 10 minutes later the waitress came by and told us my wife's order for barramundi was not entered even through we had ordered all 4 meals at the same time. her meal came about 25 minutes after ours and the waitress seemed to dessert our table and was not to be seen much again, no water refills or asking us how things were, perhaps she was embarrassed for messing up her meal? but that is certainly not the way to handle it. we had to ask a busboy to get our check.
the location and food was great but the service really lacked which isn't what you would expect from a jw marriott."|2.0|2022-02-12 14:20:00

i have stayed here before and had a good experience. i usually request a quiet room, which i did this time. the room was a little small but it was clean and comfortable. we had just got back from a long flight and we were jet lagged. we had to drive home the next day so i wanted to stay the night in the hotel to make sure we got enough sleep to drive. at around 6:30am my husband took his suitcase down to the car, well some of the housekeeping staff saw him and thought he was checking out. fair enough. so they came into the room and realized i was still in there. i wasn't mad, it was an accident! but then..they kept knocking on our door every few hours until we left at 11:45 to see if they could clean the room. we couldn't find a do not disturb sign anywhere.|2.5|2021-10-18 02:00:00

"as much as i enjoyed the food, the noise level was almost deafening, you can also tell that whoever designed the place had one goal and one goal only, get as many people in as possible and have it look good on a small smartphone screen for social media.
walking in is a convoluted experience, and the first thing i saw was a large screen tv playing commercials almost immediately took me out of the experience. the paintings are obvious prints, that don't look that great up close. which wouldn't be an issue except that we sat directly in front of one.
there's a lot that could be done to improve upon the noise level and decor, some sound absorptions panels installed on the ceilings or walls would be a welcome improvement, and carpet would have also been a nice touch, ultimately, i felt that i was in a (nice) hotel lobby, not a high-end resturaunt.
that being said, our waiter was excellent, the food was incredible. but whoever designed the place and chose the music needs to reflect on what motivates people to come to a restaurant like this in the first place."|3.0|2021-12-01 01:18:00

very cold when waking up at 7am in the morning. it would have been nicer to have the heating come on earlier. there was a bit of a funny smell in the accommodation and i couldn't identify where it was coming from. location was a little hard to find. the time of year made it a little slower going to work due to the icy roads and remote location of the accommodation. obviously this last point is nothing to do with the accommodation which was good overall but worth mentioning. self catering facilities where fantastic. good pressure shower with hot water. a nice electric blanket to heat your bed before going to sleep. fantastic view outside the property. stayed in january 2021|3.5|2021-01-13 00:00:00

in this case, i went to have dinner with my family on sunday january 16th, overall service and food was good. i requested the bill and ended up paying $250, transaction was reflected on the 19th on my bank statement but on the 24th they double charged me, another $250. i attempted to call the place as soon as i noticed but was informed that restaurant open at 5:00 pm, i waited and called back at 6:00 pm, i was transferred to the ""manager"", she got all my info and ""apologized"", (which i understood, it happens, i guess), she told me she will give me a follow up call the next day to fix the issue, that call nacer came in. i gave her 2 days, i had to call back at same hour and could not get a hold on her, supposedly that those matters have to be solved at the financial department and needed to call back at different hours. long story short, it's february already and still haven't had this issue solved and i had to come here to write this bad experience."|2.0|2022-02-01 18:59:00

"i must have been super stoned with the munchies when i first ate there because the 2nd time ..
meh
two weird things . . .
first weird thing - they used sliced corned beef (like for sandwiches) in the corned beef hash. this hash was not a go go but a no no. super salty. saltier than me and that's salty!!
next weird thing - so you are eating your biscuits and gravy and it seems like the biscuits are super mushy on the bottom. they get mushier and soft just like mashed potatoes. that's because they serve them on a layer of mashed potatoes. weird.
final note . . the iced tea is delicious."|3.0|2021-10-02 09:10:00

we had a group for brunch and i feel like since we had a big enough group to apply automatic tip on it that the service was not good at all. they automatically also charged a cutting cake fee just for bringing a cake in and then they brought out my cake that was brought by us and they didn't even allow us to sing happy birthday they took the cake back right away and cut it. the server would be whispering all the way on the side of the table and expect us to hear what she was saying. then while service was slow they pretty much tell us our time is out already and we're like we've been waiting for our check and then they proceed to take away one of the tables we were using. it made me feel embarrassed and bad for the guests that i invited for brunch for my birthday|2.0|2021-07-12 01:53:00

"food was very good. service staff was disorganized, but we are just recovering from lockdown. first there was confusion about who was our server. someone took our drink orders but didn't bring them; another person then came to take our drink orders. no bread provided but you can purchase a bowl of tortilla chips. they really vacuum the money out of you here. we had only one alcoholic drink and one appetizer and one dessert, but the total for dinner for four was $180. all the waiters are wearing black masks and uniforms; once the sun sets it's really hard to know which server is which. if the service improves, it will again be a good place for a special occasion. cheesecake was good, wonderful outdoor setting, pleasant music.
suggestion: buy masks in multiple colors so you can identify your servers!"|2.0|2021-06-10 01:54:00

after an extremely late arrival at the hotel, i was greeting by very warm and caring staff. staff were extremely helpful with guidance around delays at flight checkin, and offers to facilitate my early departure in any way they could. the accommodation was superb and i benefited from facilities in the executive suite, which included a wonderful work area and lounge. very welcome after a long and late drive. a big bonus is the parking in proximity to the hotel and the regular shuttle bus to the terminals. whilst my needs may have been met on request, the breakfast on offer felt a little underwhelming as someone who favours a vegetarian morning routine.|4.0|2021-09-19 02:00:00

"my husband and i went last night to try the new and improved deauville inn. we've vacationed, and now lived in sea isle for forty years. super crowded (expected that on memorial day weekend). noise level off the charts. had to shout to hear my dinner companion. limited menu. onion soup was delicious, pricey at $11. steak (prime rib) sandwich also very good. extremely pricey at $24, and skimpy on the prime rib. my husband had french fries (barely warm and under cooked) and a side salad ($9 for the salad) because the only vegan option on the menu, a mushroom ""steak"" was unavailable. seriously deauville owners, how hard would it be to keep a few impossible burgers in the freezer to throw on the grill for the occasional vegan diner? i don't think we'd come back( maybe for a drink & apps outside on a nice day for the view). service was efficient and pleasant (thanks steve) but too many other options in sea isle where we don't have to fight our way through a mob at the bar to get to a table. business looks good, place was packed, so great for the new owners, it's just not for us. atlantic city casino prices, probably to pay for the renovations and the view. and make up for pandemic closings ."|1.0|2021-05-31 15:18:00

good for a free breakfast if you're smart about what you eat. dinner menu leaves much to be desired. severely understaffed, which is horribly obvious. i hate using plastic utensils, they are beyond terrible for the environment. hire some freaking dishwashers. at dinner, the busboy was hovering, bored, and creepy. he was playing on his phone, eating candy, and swinging the package around and dropping it because he was so bored. perhaps they need to find other things for him to do. for how ok breakfast is, dinner was severely overpriced, but better than at skyline.|3.0|2022-04-19 21:02:00
cozy, historic, tavern. the menu is small, but has nice variety to please most. our food was delicious. the chicken pot pie was one of the best i've tasted. the portobello sandwich was excellent. portions moderate. the service was friendly and very attentive. it's a bit loud so conversation is a little bit of a challenge. would definitely return when visiting.|4.0|2021-12-18 03:40:44

the cleanliness of the room was not up to standard. dust on bedside tables, phone and remote indicates they weren't correctly cleaned, as well as sticky units. awful smell from the fridge and smell of smoke in the room. there was also alot of street noise and fighting outside the hotel. the pillows were also lumpy. stayed in may 2021|2.0|2021-05-02 01:00:00
brunch experience was overall ok. food was very good, but no effort made in presentation ie ham and cheese sandwich was just that - on a tiny plate. no fruit, chips, etc. coffee was great but no refill offered. we were seated at a small table for two in a tight space overlooking the front lobby, no lovely view. staff was friendly - nice decor. it was good enough to try it again.|3.0|2021-11-15 11:06:00
we ate at the bar because we enjoyed the bartender. she was very friendly and kind. we had reservations but decided to stay at the bar. it was very chilly in the entire eating area. i believe the cold air came from the hotel door next door being opened. i would never eat there again in the winter. i will be back in the summer.|4.0|2022-02-08 16:34:00

there was one woman on reception who was very friendly and professional as were the bar and restaurant staff that we interacted with. overall the hotel appeared really nice so our room was an unpleasant surprise. we checked out at 07:45 and the hotel allowed us to store our luggage until after my marathon. they also allowed me to shower in their gym when collecting our luggage. i communicated our estimated time of arrival in advance but the person checking us in didn't seem to know what they were doing or that we were staying there. they had the details and room cards ready for some other guests but not us. they asked how much we paid, thought we needed to pay more and when we arrived at our room we discovered some of our room keycards didn't work. our room was very far away and we had to carry our suitcase up many flights of stairs as the lift only went to the first floor. the hotel was very nice but unfortunately we were very disappointed with our room. it appeared run down perhaps as it was a family room. the room itself was a good size and the furniture appropriate. however, there were stains on many of the ceiling tiles. the bathroom was old and aspects of it had been fixed over the years, the unusual shower didn't really work and worst of all was that silverfish were noticed running along the floor. the hotel advertised that breakfast could be preordered and delivered to rooms but this wasn't true. our reason for staying was due to me running the limerick marathon and i was disappointed as reception told me breakfast wouldn't be ready for the advertised times. i therefore had to book a taxi and get up earlier than i would have like to so that i could go to the closest mcdonald's before returning to my room to get ready. we used the pool but were disappointed to discover after changing that we needed a padlock for each locker. i certainly didn't think this was a 4 start hotel.|1.5|2022-05-03 02:00:00

flawless service from our server casey, delicious and beautifully- presented food, and inspired and elegant cocktails cannot be faulted. we started with a shrimp cocktail and mushroom bisque, followed by smoked duck and a delmonico steak, followed by a classy rendition of carrot cake. absolutely delicious. however, we are getting the feeling that making reservations through open table gets the worst tables in a place, based on our experiences of late. we entered from inside the hotel, and were seated at a small table, without a table cloth near the entrance, and by the window to be stared at by everyone walking past. it was not until we walked out onto the river walk that we realized we were not even seated in the main restaurant area, where the ambience looked to be far superior, with table linens. we were better dressed than anyone in the place, there were plenty of empty tables, and they knew we were there to celebrate my birthday, so, that was hugely disappointing.|3.0|2021-10-02 15:02:00
we pre-ordered the surf and turf, 1.1kg of t bone steak and garlic prawns with sides, for 2 adults. we were concerned that we may not be able to eat it all, but it was so beautifully cooked and presented with 3 sauces and sides the meat was so very tender and light. the staff greg, newbie rachel and owner sean were as lovely and as attentive as ever.|5.0|2022-03-14 11:30:00

we booked the townhouse double room for a wedding that was on nearby. the location was superb and we really liked the townhouse double room. it was impeccably clean. while small, it was perfect for the two of us. we both commented how comfy the bed was and the bathroom had a lovely shower and toiletries left for us to use. the towels were lovely fresh white towels and there was plenty of them. the breakfast was also lovely and there was a great selection to choose from. the wifi was also excellent as i needed to do some work on my laptop in the morning time. loved the summerhill house, the breakfast room and foyer of hotel was very pretty and the hotel exceeded my expectations. parking was plentiful also. nothing. we liked everything. would definitely stay again.|5.0|2021-07-30 02:00:00

"restaurant did not have my booking.
food was ok but nothing to write home about.
went to the bolton's as used to have a grand restaurant and excellent range of seafood and fish.
however, had to eat in the bar and menu much reduced. had roast lamb which was not freshly carved but pre-cut slices.
asked for receipt for contactless payment. noted that had on it a bh1 postcode, which is for brighton! would have caused me concern and a lot of sorting out when checking my account if had not asked for receipt and spotted this."|2.0|2022-01-07 08:02:00

"what a pleasant surprise. we were in okc for the weekend and could not decide where to eat an early dinner on a saturday night. pulled up the open table app to see where we could get a reservation on very short notice and not have to drive too far from our hotel. we settled on rococo western. had not been there before so decided to give it a try. so glad we did. everything was fabulous. our waitress ashley was a delight. the interior design was very appealing. chef bruce rinehart was out and about and very approachable. we started with the ""cookie"" sampler - toasted baguette slices with various topping - and they were very good. the star of the show though was the bay scallop & mushroom risotto that we split for an entree. the risotto was cooked perfectly - maybe the best risotto i've had in a restaurant, and the scallops were delicious. finished our meal with the pumpkin cheesecake which was also fabulous. nice selection of wine by the glass and bottle and a fully stocked bar. will definitely add rococo western to our rotation of okc restaurants that we frequent when in town."|5.0|2021-12-06 13:46:00
"it's definitely not the pink taco from hard rock days. it was so disappointingthe whole casino was nothing like i expected. pluswhen my chicken enchiladas came out it looked like uncooked marinated meat. i ate the tiny street taco & some rice. the waitress asked if she could get me something else but i said no because we waited forever for it the first time. my drink was $14 (i believe) & was in a small cup, like i have for milk for the gkids at home.
our waitress was so wonderful & attentive. she is definitely a great worker & you are lucky to have her.
alsothere was snug white poodle type dog that was allowed inside the restaurant??& no it was not a service dog! it's gotten ridiculousto allow an animal indoors where people eat.

our server was as good as she could be on the day. it seemed like she did not feel well.

it was close to a wedding we were attending. it was very clean and comfortable. enjoyed the breakfast. when checking in there was 2 people on at the check in desk and they were busy with guests so we were wait to be checked in which is fine but when one of the staff finished with a customer she walked away and left us waiting even longer. i thought she should have checked us in before she left the desk. on her return back to the desk she was just ignoring us so i had to go to her and ask her could we please check us in as we were at a wedding in another hotel and needed to get back as the dinner was being served. now i have to say she of course checked us in and was very pleasant but i just felt as a professional she shouldn't have left us waiting so long because customer service is priceless. disbite this our stay was lovely.|4.0|2022-04-23 02:00:00

we had a birthday reservation for saturday brunch. we were greeted right away, taken to our table and sat. we placed out drink orders - mimosas, french 75 bottle of champagne, we were then told they were out of bubbles, out of strawberry and couldn't make several drinks on the brunch menu! it is brunch, the expectation is to have a brunch cocktail, in most cases. this could have been shared with our group before being seated to allow us the chance to go somewhere else. the food took a while to arrive and they weren't busy at the time, items were added to our orders (and brought out) that we didn't order. the ambiance is cute, the food is mediocre at best and whoever orders their liquor needs to be fired.|1.0|2021-08-09 19:06:00
"this was a difficult review to write because there was so many mixed feelings on the overall experience.
plenty of free parking, once you park you walk to the hotel, take the elevator up to roof and you're right there, quick and easy access.
we had reservations and were seated right away. the first thing we noticed was the amazing ambience, 1010. classy guests, in fact i felt a little underdressed.
our waitress was great. she was on top of everything and very sharp, that was 1010 as well.
now for the disappointments.
the menu was a spanish fusion type. to be quite honest it was hard to make out what was on the menu. it's almost as if they're trying too hard to be sophisticated thinking it would add more class.
when we got our apps it was mediocre and i'm being nice. we had some pork type of dish which had a lot of fat on there. then we had dinner. all 3 of us had the steak. while it was very tasty it was also a bit cold. not to the point where we would send it back but c'mon, steak has to be served hot, that's 101. it was clear that the steaks had cooled off. easy fix for this is to have the steak served on heated plates. overall the food was a 3 or 4 out of 10.
now for the drinks, and this was probably even more of a let down than the food. we ordered the followingannoyedn-house moscow mule
-mojito
-dry martini
their drinks are off, they don't taste what their supposed to, very bland. i don't know if the bartender was off that day or what. but a place like this cannot have below average drinks. i score the drinks a 2 or 3 out of 10.
our bill was over $300 and we were just 3 people and we didn't order a lot of food and drinks. the overall value is a 110 for our money.
the place has so much potential. my advice is to get a new bartender asap.
2nd, go basic on the menu. basic but tasty. bring some sliders and fries. they didn't even have fries on the menu. i called and gave my opinions and was told the manager would call me but he never did. that was also disappointing."|1.0|2021-04-11 18:31:00

warren house very run down. corridor from reception to far end where toilets are, there was a terrible smell , very uninviting. carpet threadbare, decor very tied and no ambience. dining room where tea was, very quiet which was excellent for chatting, but no atmosphere. plain scone had not been put on tea selection, was on menu, as elderly guest was unable to have scone with sultana. on request, a quite a wait the plain scones for one person arrived. sandwiches were dry at corners, did not seem fresh and very uninteresting and bland, quite stale almost. little cakes were good and scones were good. best part was kind service from lovely waitress. not good value for money and we used to go there often and had had two big events there but really very tired now and the reception, dining and bar needs a definite uplift.|1.0|2022-02-20 15:27:00

on check in the lovley girl who was looking after us kindly upgraded us to a room with a view for no extra charge. she was very polite, helpfull and the perfect first impression when arriving to the hotel. it was the evening of the 29th of september 2022. if a manager or supervisor is reading this, i urge you to check who was on the desk that evening and give her a raise wink there on street parking available. no secure on site parking. however, it's good to know that you could purchase the pay&display ticket from the machine on the street the night before so you dont have to get up at 9am when the parking kicks in and buy the ticket then. plus it's very cheap to park. i think it was about 30c per hour.|4.0|2022-10-27 02:00:00

our first time eating at the deauville inn, off-season in october. there were quite a number of diners there, both indoors and out. noise levels were fairly high, perhaps due to a section reserved for a party. i imagine it would be ear-splitting during the summer. our server was pleasant and attentive. my husband enjoyed the she-crab soup and seafood pot pie, and my scallops with a side of crispy roasted brussels sprouts were tasty.|4.0|2021-10-23 19:49:00

"we had a wonderful time! it was a beautiful evening and this was the ideal spot to enjoy the sunset. our server was professional and charming. the food was delicious. i've noted some reviews complaining about prices, but we found that the quality of the food fully supported the expense. this is an upscale location compared to some of the other ""dockside"" restaurants in newport. it's off the beaten track and there's none of the hustle and bustle of the more touristy places. our fellow diners were mostly hotel guests, families enjoying the night in front of one of the many fire pits with their well-behaved children, or visitors like us, nicely attired and prepared to pay for a leisurely dockside dinner."|5.0|2021-09-07 07:35:00

the waitress at dinner was lovely and polite the receptionist at checkout was also polite staff where rude and unfriendly. the receptionist at check-in was just rude and almost dismissive towards me and my wife. the staff serving breakfast had a loud conversation in earshot of us. we arrived for breakfast at 10:50am all the tables were empty and set except one, the waitress made us stand and wait till she wiped it down the only table that wasn't set, to sit there because the rest of the restaurant was reserved for dinner time, this made no senseit was 10:50am. when we did sit down and order our breakfast, we could hear the waitress being questioned loudly by another staff member as to why we were onlt sitting down now. we could hear the waitress say that we were bb and the other staff said why are they only coming down at this time, the waitress saud perhaps they got up late. all this despite the fact the breakfast is served from 8am to 12pm.this conversation continued at a loud volume about us and we could hear the entire conversation about us, clearly creating an uncomfortable atmosphere. staff either not wearing masks or just having them placed on their chins or around wrist.|1.5|2021-06-20 02:00:00

i've loved coming to marco polo. they have simple and very delicious food and very special atmosphere of resort place just in a middle of silver lake. our personal favourites are cacio pepe pasta, burger, cucumber salad with side of chicken, burrata. their food is always delicious and we are happy coming back. but most recently service level declined a lot. people wait 2-3 minutes to be greeted at entrance, then wait another 5 minutes for the server to offer drinks, then the server forgets to ask if i want another drink - not a good experience. i hope they solve their management issues and people will again enjoy delicious food and perfect service.|4.0|2021-08-28 19:11:00

it was a nice place the hospitality wasn't great by the owner. his wife was lovely.. but the man.. we had a feeling he didn't like us staying there. when we asked for wifi he said he didn't have any when on the website it said they had. i heard him give the password to someone else. when we asked him if he could heat out baby's food.. he made a face as if he didn't want to. we didn't get any info on the hotel either as in we have to leave the key on reception when going out.. or we need to book in advance for dinner and breakfast.. the man was very hostile.|2.5|2021-07-22 02:00:00
we had thanksgiving dinner with the grandparents and it was delicious and so stress-free! they had a traditional turkey dinner that was amazing (the winter veggie soup was delicious! the green beans had a little snap and full of flavor! the stuffing wasn't too dry or too soft! turkey was..well, i'm not a big fan of turkey in general, but it was as good as i have had). the best part was that they also had the full menu available, so my kids were able to get whatever they wanted (chicken tenders and a ny strip steak that was cooked perfectly), instead of being locked into a limited price-fixed menu. the service was great and very responsive to our busy group. we may make it an annual tradition!|5.0|2021-11-26 17:38:00
when we left when we were asked at 1 o clock to keep the noise down we were woken up by banging on our door by the manger that i had to answer in my under wear only to find out the next morning that it was a room 2 doors up from us that had caused trouble and the excuses were that they had to tell every room to be quiet incase the room who caused trouble started again a poor excuse and a joke that we had to be told go back to sleep because they couldnt give out to the guests that started the issue you dont knock on guests rooms to say someone else caused trouble very poor management|2.0|2022-02-06 01:00:00

the staff were nice. a lovely young man checked us in couldn't have been nicer..the girls servicing the rooms were nice a polite and asked did we need anything..our room was upgraded from what we booked and the view was fabulous, they have a lovely short walk behind the hotel. even tho the hotel is having some renovations it didn't take in anyway from our stay. i was rang on thursday to pre-book our breakfast time for sunday and monday. when given times to book we decided to book for half ten(breakfast is on till 11) on the sunday breakfast was fine buffet style which was super fine for us. on monday we came down a few minutes before half 10 there was barely anything in the buffet hot food two eggs and three sausages, there was rashers and puddings available..when i asked the staff was there more food coming out they were nice and said they would get us fresh eggs and sausages, when we went around the rest of the buffet there was no mushrooms or hashbrowns. when we sat down to eat the staff started to clean up straight away all the food was taken away and all the cereal was removed..no one came down and asked were we finished or would we like anything else before they cleared up, we felt very rush and not very welcome on monday for breakfast, even tho we had to prebook our time and they knew we would be there at that time|3.5|2021-11-16 01:00:00

"phenomenal service by kendall and all other staff and unreal outdoor seating area just before sunset made our ""splurge"" night in lahaina a night to remember. and it is a splurge, but we'll worth every penny. my husband and i decided to do the apps and salads sharing technique so we could try a little of everything. we started with the unctious buttery bone marrow and the light coconut cured poisson cru that unintentionally complimented one another perfectly. then the salads. my beet box served in a treasure chest and his ahi poke salad. though ubiquitous in the islands, this ahi poke salad stood out from all the others we have sampled in our trips to hawaii. the sauce was creamy without being heavy and melted along with the fish on our tongues. the daikon it was presented on was thoughtfully marinated and didn't compete with the fish. we ordered some malasadas to go and enjoyed every doughy delightful bite on our hotel lanai. beautiful from start to finish and definitely worth the price."|5.0|2021-11-25 05:28:00

everything was perfect except for one issue. i have a major problem with not being able to add tips to card payments. after dinner, i asked the restaurant staff if i can add a tip to my payment and was told no. i asked because i have worked in the industry and i know some places still hold onto all card payments including tips for staff. most people don't carry cash any more, find a way to let your staff keep their well deserved tips! i'm not interested in paying extra to the establishment, i am interested in tipping the people who took good care of me. sort it out!|4.0|2021-07-21 02:00:00

we were all really excited to go to the globe for our family christmas eve meal. we had saved up and planned to go there for ages, looking at the menus and viewing the website etc. the evening was very disappointing and we wouldn't pay to eat there again! the food was poor and not restaurant standard. the pulled pork burger was really salty and had no texture to the meat it was more like a sloppy joe. the burger buns were burnt. for the price of the adult meals there was no flare or culinary skill used, no choice of sides like onion rings or veg. the burgers were poor quality and the adult portions were exactly the same size as the children's 7.50 portion. so we paid three times the price for a few extra flavourless fries. really uninspiring menu, poorly cooked and outdated food presentation.|1.0|2021-12-26 14:34:00

"it was ok but not a repeat for us.
food
notified of celiac disease but not prepared. offered salad with no dressing. got salmon but came a la carte. daughter got chicken teriyaki but came with skin on. obviously not the end of the world but a surprise when biting into it nonetheless. i got the sashimi plate and the fish was excellent. one of the 5 selections seemed like a sardine. i tried it but not for me.
service
waitress seemed in a hurry despite us being an early-ish reservation and only 4 parties seated at that point. we described her as mostly efficient but cold and definitely rushed.
ambience
inside it's a typical sushi place. mostly quiet and reserved, which we liked. outside it's a really cool hotelmotel kind of thing. hard to describe but like something out of an old-school japanese martial arts movie. we really liked it.
so overall it was an interesting experience and not too expensive ($104 without drinks for 3) but we won't return."|3.0|2021-09-08 05:51:00

"a tad disappointed. we had high expectations for carversteak and perhaps a few more weeks to get all the kinks out may have been a better option.
we used the valet service for our car to which the attendant informed us that the valet charge would be $25 a tad steep for an off boulevard hotel.
we then had to walk 800 yards to carversteak good thing i wore my walking boots. the valet attendant could have sent us to a closer valet station, they have 4 stations. i guess he wanted the $20 tip that i dished out prior to knowing the distance we would need to walk.
once in the restaurant all was good until they sat a group of four quite loud gentlemen at the table next to us. the music was nice but we couldn't hear it, partially because of the restaurant's acoustics and the loud table next to us.
the service was excellent until they tried to deliver a drink order that the table next to us had ordered. the menu did not list their selection of 375ml wine bottles so we had to wait for the wine specialist to provide their options.
dinner finally, the baby lettuce wedges were very good but $19 was a tad steep for lettuce, a few cherry tomatoes, bacon bits and a little dressing. ya get what ya pay for, the profit margin on this item is impressive! oh yea that brings me back to my old fashioned adult beverage - again a very handsome profit margin! our filets were outstanding, tender as possible! the brussel sprouts were outstanding but the potato croutons were fresh out of the freezer - not worth the coin.
there was no mango sorbet so we had to settle for passion fruit sorbet. concurrently, they had to make a run to a different bar to grab a bottle of drambuie for an ordered ""drambuie on the rocks"" but delivered neat. they were kind enough to put a few ice cubes in the drink.
finally the bill came to $336 so i made it an even $410 tip included. we will return but with so many choices in vegas i'm not sure when??"|4.0|2022-01-07 09:30:00
lovely lunch in the end although it did not get off to a good start, the greeter had his mask on his chin and had no customer skills. i had called ahead with an intolerance request and expected to be told what i could and could not have, this person just said choose from the menu and we will tell you if it is ok. fortunately other staff were more helpful and we ordered. the food was excellent and we were served promptly. no chilean wine on the wine list so we had new zealand which at 28:50 a bottle was really not worth it. a little plate of fruit and brownies came at the end with a birthday candle too.|4.0|2022-01-15 13:47:00

"a warm welcome on arrival and then taken through the lovely welcoming and absolutely buzzing bar area to our table. the service was attentive without being intrusive. the food was exquisite, but then i didn't expect anything less given the owners pedigree. my partner ordered a trio starter that included korean beef, mackerel and beetroot amongst other ingredients that escape my memory. i had a game broth. it was very tasty but unfortunately it was a little dark around our table so i could not see the contents of the broth. nonetheless it was lovely. mains were, sea bass for my partner and steak for me. again both were fantastic but i must mention that i was expecting chips with my steak. it did come with a form of chips which were cleverly layered strips of potato that were deep fried. very interesting. the whole experience was great and when chef, mark hix sauntered over for a chat it just made the evening more special. the fact that it appears that all ingredients are sourced from local producers makes it even better, apart from some wines, obviously.
we will be back again soon."|5.0|2022-01-01 13:14:00
"a lovely setting alongside the thames
lovely touches to enhance our dining experience - bramley hand sanitiser, blankets offered against cold wind. the patio heater was helping to keep the chill away. i had a lovely meal with friends. the food looked very good however i think i picked badly with my crab and lobster tortellini. we had a lovely afternoon and enjoyed a couple of glasses of the chablis (sold by the glass). our waitress was charming and looked after us well."|4.0|2021-05-08 14:07:00

this is a beautiful space and the waitstaff was friendly. however, our drinks came quite late and one person in our party did not receive her first drink until after the appetizer arrived. the food was pleasant but bland. another person ordered a second drink but it never appeared. the restaurant would have made a lot more money and we would have enjoyed our experience more if they spaced out drinks, apps and main meals better.|3.0|2021-10-31 13:49:00

we had a really lovely weekend at the granville. the staff were so helpful and friendly, the location right in town and just across from the pier was perfect. the hotel itself has an old country house kind of decor, feels quite dandy but also homely. and then the breakfast - so good! they had all the usual buffet options available as courses, so essentially we had about 4 courses to choose from on the menu. really delicious start to the day. nothing|5.0|2021-07-30 02:00:00

"love the decor and our server was really nice with a beautiful singing voice. we were their first the high tea and highball experience so you could not order from the regular menu, it was a set menu.
the tea was amazing, unfortunately the food was not. they are not setup for making gluten free options that were equivalent to the regular finger sandwiches.
i made reservations well in advance and then when it was time to have our finger sandwiches and scones they had no scones. they said they were out and substituted with broken chocolate chip cookies and said to dip the cookies in the lemon curd and cream.
it just does not make sense to have high tea without scones."|2.0|2021-10-04 19:33:00

i thought the food average and lacked spice and over cooked so dry. i have been before a couple of years ago and had a very different experience and really enjoyed it, but this time it didn't have a fine dining experience and therefore the price was over the top. i felt the staff wanted us to finish and leave so we had to take our wine to the bar to have a coffee and nobody asked to help. i love the hotel but wouldn't go again to sindhi. overall very disappointing.|3.0|2021-11-05 21:27:00

the food and the view from our room overlooking the water and watching shops sail by i didn't like the entrance to the carpark. i got a worrying feeling when i heard the bottom of the car scraping off the entrance (my car isn't lowered in any way its a standard audi a6) and also on the way out, so i proceeded to park in the street after that|5.0|2022-02-28 01:00:00
i ordered the 'award winning'pie, and what a disappointment it was. soggy, mushy pastry, dry meat and not great on flavour. the hand cut chips were more like skin on wedges. the staff were great but didn't take the meal off the bill just 8 which i felt was very poor. i've eaten here before and it was amazing. i'm sad to say we won't return.|3.0|2022-01-02 17:14:00

leaving the next morning and never going back bed and room was good and well laid out. food was terrible our dinner on the night we stayed was a joke. over an hour waiting for main course and when it came to the table it was over cooked but cold!! obviously sat on the kitchen waiting to go out for far to long. we sent the whole thing back. for the price we paid for the room we got up to cold showers as there was no hot water in either the shower or the wash hand basin. for a hotel of its supposed calibre this stay for us was no more than a joke!! i realise that not everyone has a good experience all the time but this is our second stay here and both times we have had issues. we won't be back again.|2.0|2022-03-06 01:00:00

what went well was the marvellous lady who was working at reception when we arrived and when we left the following morning. such a welcome and appreciation of our visit when we were leaving we struggled with the call bell on the lift each time coming down stairs. dinner was not great. i spoke to the lady in charge, who spoke to the chef and they agreed that what was on the menu was not what i was served. i was offered something else but i didn't want another dinner. besides there not being tofu in the dish, the base of the aubergine was not cooked so it was not possible to eat it. on a very personal issue. why is it necessary for bar staff in lots of bars to serve a glass filled with ice with a gin and tonic. the melting ice totally dilutes the gin!|3.5|2022-02-16 01:00:00

the service was poor, we were shown to our table and were told someone would come to get our drinks order, no one came so we got them ourselves. one of the starters was missing it main ingredients, we had to go and find someone as no one was around, we think they were shorted staffed. the carbonara was dry and the scrambled egg did not help as that was over cooked too. we ordered a side of bread which never came and the bill had omitted the drinks, so we had to get them to change it. first time we have been it did nor appear very busy, what a shame.|4.0|2021-12-13 11:26:00

came here for valentines day date with hubby of 10 years, we both agreed its a very pretty place to sit and eat however his burger was basic but delicious, but not worth the 36 dollars price tag. it's more like a $20 burger, and i had the salmon yes delicious but also small portions. i could get the same salmon for less at the cheesecake factory with bigger portions. you're paying for the ambiance at the rooftop. however, our waiter was nice.|4.0|2022-02-25 15:54:00

birthday weekend trip and had lunch and breakfast here. food is not very good. they gave us birthday cups and said free drinks in the hotel but it was near impossible to get drinks and then they said well it's really just soda which little kids don't drink so that is a huge bummer. the lighting in one area of the restaurant was not working so we ate in the dark pretty much. they need some improvements here. buffet breakfast was very basic and no frills.|3.0|2021-10-02 20:58:00

we had heard wonderful things about augustine inn so we decided to go for our date night. we were sat directly in front of the band, very hard to have a conversation with the other couple while they were playing. i will say our server was very nice & courteous, just not very prompt. it took forever to get drinks & for her to come back around after our drinks were empty, empty glasses were not cleared from the table which was not very big. appetizers came out very swiftly & were delicious. after waiting a very long time for our meals to come, only one of our meals & one persons' side came out & part of the meal & the side was cold. it took several minutes after that for the rest of our meals to come out. which were piping hot & delicious. again, the food was delicious, but just not the experience we'd expect to have after all of the great things we've heard.|2.0|2021-11-26 14:39:00

a strange experience. we arrived half an hour before our booked dinner time for a drink in the bar. but we were told there was no bar. we were told outside tables were full but i could see from the restaurant an almost empty outside area. the food and wine were good but the service was efficient rather than friendly. it was not a cheap meal but we never really felt welcome. by contrast the hotel reception staff were very friendly and helpful.|3.0|2021-09-14 08:08:00

we won't be going back. this used to be an excellent restaurant - perfect for dining before events at the music center or disney. no longer - it's almost as if management is trying to deter people not staying at the hotel from dining there. the main entry points from the music center are locked - although the signage indicates those doors are open until 9 pm. when you arrive at the restaurant after a circuitous path, there is no one to greet you - either at the entry point or further inside the hotel proper. the menu is uninteresting (it used to be a good one), and the food served ordinary at best. service is not good - we had to wait 45 minutes following a simple order from a simple menu, only to find that two different waitstaff brought the appetizers and the main courses virtually simultaneously. we were even asked on being seated to provide a credit card up front - highly unusual and highly unprofessional - which we refused to do. the manager was apologetic, saying that they were operating on a limited basis (the actual dining room was not open - only seating in the bar area) and would improve. maybe they will (and i hope they do, as it is convenient), but it will take a number of enthusiastic reviews to get us to chance it. we generally invite people to the music center, with dinner prior. this time it was mercifully only the two of us. if we had guests, in addition to the bad experience we had, embarrassment at taking people there would have been an additional problem|1.0|2021-10-25 00:39:00

"we drive by this place several times a day and decided to try it. the menu is a little something for everyone. the mussels were very flavorful with hints of coconut and cilantro two. three slices of toasted baguette enabled us to really absorb the flavor. the irish corned beef reuben was excellent. this was not your average sliced deli meat. thick slices sandwiched between slices of marble rye makes this something we will be ordering in a regular basis. we also enjoyed the wings smothered in a bourbon glaze.
amanda our waitress was a pro. she provided knowledge on all of our dishes in addition to the different beers and wines.

great location for accessing the sights of connemara. short stroll to the village where there are two bars and a small shop and cafe. basic room with sea views which were fab. pity balcony is not big enough to sit out. standing room only. food was nice. very busy at dinner and breakfast so booking is essential. staff were very nice and friendly. one way system in operation. quite basic rooms. no lift|3.5|2021-06-29 02:00:00

extremely disappointed really had high hopes. the views are nice but the service really lacked it took 10 mins for the staff to figure out who was waiting on our table. the umbrella was broken so i ended up holding on to it because apparently our only options were the broken umbrella or the sun in our faces. they brought out the appetizers with our meals so the room on the table was very tight. the charcuterie plate was overpriced for what you get but the humus plate was really good. the salad with beets and goat cheese was tasty and the burger was good nothing amazing. the drinks were refreshing we order the la girl and the violet something. the bartender was sweet enough to make a mocktail for our bestie who's pregnant but seating us in a high top table wasn't ideal.|1.0|2021-08-03 06:34:00

baked alaska pudding was okay but a bit too frozen in the middle.

"my party of 4 went to gerrard street kitchen for easter brunch. the only thing they were serving was a $75 price fixed menu. i should've known something was wrong because the place was almost empty when i arrived. the only other diners in the restaurant's indoor dining room were at a single long table near the bar. there were about 4 adults, one of whom was speaking so loud he was practically yelling. even louder were the roughly 4 children at his table. the kids were actually screaming and the adults were doing nothing about it. the server, who told us others had left because of the loud diners, asked them to quiet down and they didfor one minute. then the screaming started again.
the brief experience we had with the food was also unfortunate. we were brought the first course which was a 2 ""baskets"" of muffins and croissants4 total in each basket. the muffins and croissants were very small, the croissants were rubbery, and there was no butter. that seemed a bit cheap and low quality for $75 per person. we then ordered ice tea, but they brought us apple juice insteadapparently someone but juice in the ice tea carafe. the server went back to get the ice tea, but then advised they didn't have any and it would take over 20 minutes to make it! that mishap, on top of the $25 parking fee to park at the hotel even if you were dining at the restaurant, was the last straw. we left immediately, ruining our easter brunch plans. i will say that our server was very polite and apologetic, and the restaurant didn't charge us for the joke of a muffin basket."|1.0|2022-04-18 02:19:00

food was decent- service was abysmal. everything went wrong that could go wrong to the point where it was clear that they really didn't care whether we were there or not. the waiter had a mask but kept it either under his chin despite the omicron surge that's currently happening. it took us forever to get menus, have our orders taken, get the check. when the food came out 2 out of the 6 of us had our orders forgotten so the people had to start eating while they cooked the 2 they forgot. they even couldn't find a pen that worked when it was time for the check! the bright side? everyone thought their food tasted great despite the distraction that nothing was going smoothly otherwise. never going there again.|2.0|2021-12-26 20:13:00

"it's impossible to get a reservation even as a guest at the hotel. why wouldn't you reserve a few tables for guests? since there was no pre-arrival email i had no idea that reservations were difficult to come by.
upon arrival, the whole process of checking in with the hostess and then waiting for a table feels like an assembly line at a factory. they need to make it a little more elegant and not so factory-like.
beyond thatannoyedn
no dress code so some people show up in sweats and t-shirts.
i was seated at a table for 1 with my back to the windows even though lots of other tables for 1 and 2 were available. the leather benches are too low for the tables.
the wait staff was overworked and understaffed. took 20 minutes for the waiter, stephen, to show up after being seated.
waiter kept calling me ""friend,"" which was unprofessional.
they have a sommelier, also called steven, but he doesn't anything. literally didn't know half of what was on the wine list. constantly tried getting me to buy $150-$180 bottles and told me to my face they didn't have what i knew they had. turns out they had it when i ordered it.
no bread.
wine was never poured for me beyond the first class.
zero privacy between tables. hardly romantic if you're on a date and have to crawl over people. i had to ask the people at the neighboring table to get up when i needed to use the toilet. that's how close the tables are.
my entree, the black cod, was served cold. the replacement, a filet, was served incorrectly. i left. they were gracious enough not to charge me for the food but i did pay for the wine as i drank the wine.
this place has tremendous potential but it is falling way short of the fine dining expectations set by the prices."|2.0|2022-02-21 13:26:00

"very enjoyable overall experience in this brand new hotel & restaurant.
the food is cooked really fresh cooked pretty much to perfection (i had the turbot) although the frites side dish was far too salty.
the main dishes are quite large portions so could be easily shared which was actually encouraged by my waiter kevin who was a very attentive and friendly guy. i actually came out of the restaurant feeling really full so could have cut back on the amount ordered. in fact we did ask to take away some of the desert ordered but was told it was not permitted. quite frankly i found that ridiculous as it just went to waste and it's food we had paid for.
a great place to celebrate an occasion like anniversary or birthday as it has a fantastic location on the corner of leicester square and has a nice ambience. the restaurant was quite full at the time so was a little on the noisy side but not too overbearing. we could still talk quite comfortably.
i would recommend this to anyone as an occasional treat."|4.0|2021-09-16 19:10:00

"out with the family to celebrate my wife's birthday, on arrival the atmosphere was vibrant and bustling with the whole place decorated tastefully for christmas. subtle music level playing in the background just helped bolster this further.
the menu offering last night was a fantastic combination of fresh and tasty (eg crab starter) modern classics (thick cut hamduck egg & chips), seasonally comforting (turkeyham suet pud with winter veg or pork belly) and a creative festive twist that was pure genius, rather than tackynaff two of which i dove in with gusto (pigs n blankets with cranberry hummus) & (christmas pudclotted cream parfait, accompanied with the cutest ever gingerbread biscuits). the team go beyond courteous, making sure you feel looked after without being over bearing of forced. normally i devour one of their tasty iterations of moules, only to be equalled pre lockdown by rumour in totnes!, so i don't say this lightly, but personally can't recommend this fantastic establishment high enough. well done & thank you team mussel inn, 6 very satisfied customers who will definitely be back for more soon."|5.0|2021-12-04 12:38:00

"first time visit and booked here after reading positive reviews and the nice pics on their website - exceeded our expectations on every level!
a lot of work has been done during lockdown and they've created a modern, cosy, smart, premium feel environment with the ambience and atmosphere of a warm feel pub.
the service was faultless and the food incredible (how the chef bakes bread around camembert is a mystery, but a real delight!).
we booked again before leaving!"|4.0|2021-09-27 12:52:00

really nice people, good seating area by the breakfast, easy to find your way around. good space in the shower, comfy bed and well functional window blackout. great stay over choice for the road traveller. not a real negative - the premises are worn and not a place where you would spend a luxury weekend, but that is not the purpose of this hotel. it is just by the main road, which means a less attractive view outside. for the price and purpose this is to be expected.|5.0|2021-12-16 01:00:00
i had a really great stay. everyone was so welcoming and warm. the breakfast is really great, especially as you have a beautiful view into the garden. and the location is amazing, 5min away from sandymount beach and 10min into sandymount village. and after you come back from a nice walk, you can enjoy a complimentary cup of tea in the drawing room. what more can you ask for? everything was great|4.5|2021-11-09 01:00:00
very central great location the room location was a disaster , we were awake all night as whoever was staying in room above us were up all night drinkingtalking laughing in their room and we could hear everything ! they might as well have been in our room .it's not the people above us i'm blaming as you should be able to chat etc in your room but it was as if the ceiling was paper thin and the roof was going to cave in anytime they walked around their room . very very disappointed as none of us got sleep for the full night .|1.0|2022-02-26 01:00:00

i have never written an open table review but everyone who lives in the suburbs should add this to their list - the food is amazing and yes it's in a hotel lobby, but that means it's a lot more spacious and airy than most crowded restaurants right now. you can actually have a conversation w 6 people at one table wout yelling smile we had a lot of the apps and entrees between the 6 of us - all great!|5.0|2021-11-21 17:48:00

"friendly staff, nice dinner, fish & chips, close to the airport.. the room that i booked was an executive room, ""with luxury toiletries and bathrobes and slippers"" non of which were in the room. the room was very basic. i glad i didn't book a standard room. what was in this ""deep cleaned rooms"" was two large cobwebs hanging over the bed, with a dirty stain on one off the pillows. no so deep cleaned.. room 251. staff friendly, dinner was nice, fish & chips, but the decor of the bar restaurant seats could be reupholstered, as they were threadbare on the seats. fabric completely worn away. on a positive not, its close to the airport, but you do hear the planes taking off,as well as road traffic."|3.0|2021-03-02 01:00:00
the staff i interacted with were so helpful and polite, especially the night time staff who let me into the hotel on my arrival and allowed me back outside to get a cheeky pizza. food on-site is also quite nice, great quality and wide variety. same with their drink selection. the bedroom is spacious with very comfy and clean beds. bathroom was superbly clean with plenty of towels, and the shower was brilliant. staff in the hotel are genuinely amazing! just a bit of confusion upon entering the restaurant as to whether we were booked in or not. we got in no problem, but i was called a couple days before my arrival to book a time in the restaurant, though when i got there nobody asked me about a reservation. i'm assuming this was just in case the restaurant was starting to get busy. wasn't a problem at all really just had me confused!|4.5|2021-06-26 02:00:00

"our family had dinner twice during a stay in southern californian. at our first dinner, the restaurant was out of chips, shrimp, and all salads of any form. service was descent but never saw the manager to apologize or explain anything. when asked to put the check on the hotel bill, it required the manger and he was ""busy"" and we were asked to wait about 5 minutes until he could come to our table. during our second visit, the food was available but the service was spotty with our waitress disappearing for long periods of time. although there are plenty of people on the floor working on the restaurant, the service is not great. in general i would say the food is very good, the ambiance and decor are excellent. i just don't think the management cares that much about service or customer's experience. it is almost the feeling you get in a club; ""just be glad you are here and we get to you when we get to you""."|4.0|2022-02-22 13:05:00

"i went to the stage at the londoner hotel on new year's day after a five star meal at the restaurant the whitford, was really looking forward to finishing an excellent evening with a few glasses of champagne, and great live music; however i was disappointed on both. firstly was going to order a bottle of bollinger but none was in stock, (the second 5 star hotel i visited in a week to have run out!) luckily, your very helpful waitress let us sample a few alternatives before we settled on an acceptable alternative. the second issue was the live music, which was poor; to be honest it would have been better to play a cd over the speakers to create a better and more exciting atmosphere and ambience. i noticed many people leaving after 20 minutes of this; we also left earlier than planned.
i hope the live music selection gets better and becomes a 'go to' venue as your hotel has a lot of potential and i was hoping to book a stay for new year eve or over christmas in the future."|2.0|2022-01-11 11:29:00

the room was quite dirty with stains on carpets and chairs. small room. bed was okay, but the bathroom has a clogged shower. the room itself had no access to proper wifi. when notifying one of the staff, they just said that's their only network and moved on. didn't offer to change places. or help with anything. room was small and stained everywhere. shower was clogged and the layover was really poor with the doors. additionally there is such a huge gap in the doors that you have light coming in lots and you can hear everything in the hallways and in the 3 rooms beside you. this also includes the housekeepers that start yelling and laughing with each other at 910am in the morning. so if you want a night sleep or any wifi, the two things that are pretty important for accommodation, then this isn't the place for you. wouldn't stay again.|1.5|2021-11-30 01:00:00

i really liked the sky tv, it was a nice treat. the bedroom was very big and spacious. the bathroom was very modern. requested towels and they never came. the breakfast app needs improvement. it is not flexible enough when ordering. there is not enough parking.|3.5|2021-07-18 02:00:00

always a treat to eat at the ancient fleece, among blackened timber, apotropaic symbols and open fires. a good line up of excellent real ales (a stout or porter always available would be a welcome addition) and the new chef has kept up the high standard of meals. i will continue to make our regular detour when travelling up and down the m5 to continue to experience this outstanding historic pub.|5.0|2021-10-06 13:07:00
quick and efficient check in, along with the free shuttle from the airport, the room was also clean and comfortable. buffet breakfast was luke warm to cold for the price expected better, the meal in the bar was good hot and delicious but the surroundings could have done with a clean the dust was sitting thick on the shelf beside my seat!|4.0|2022-05-21 02:00:00

the food was great and the service was excellent. i would have loved to try a dessert but we were quite full from the mains and had booked our table for 8:30 so it was quite late when we had finished eating. lovely evening, would recommend."|4.0|2021-06-16 14:09:00

what a great find! delicious food in a beautiful, historic location. we were seated in the dining room and instantly fell in love with the wooden beams, exposed brick, and oversized fireplace. everything we ordered was delicious. the lobster stew is a showstopper, and the crab cakes were mostly crab with barely any filler. drinks and service were also great. next time we are in the area, we will definitely return.|5.0|2021-11-23 19:09:00

we dined at petrini's on a holiday weekend. there were so many people around we could not get a reservation anywhere so ended up trying this as it was close to our hotel. our server worked super hard to make it a pleasant experience but the place was just too busy! we waited such an unacceptably long time for our dinner for (3). there was way too much garlic for my taste but maybe other people love that. i think what the real problem is - they take too many carry out orders so the kitchen was slammed meaning anyone dining in has to wait an hour+ to get their meal. i wanted to really love this place as we stay at the nearby hotel often. it's a great location and the patio is pleasant for people watching.|2.0|2022-02-23 19:33:00

no special or specific extras for customers. no milk except small condiments, no bottled water. no napkins. no specials to make customers feel special during their stay. the bar and restaurant was really crowded even to consider a meal or drink. the machines didn't take cards for euro exchange and the staff weren't friendly or accommodating. too over priced as mentioned above would not stay at hotel again. lovely area by the beach but opposing staff.|1.0|2022-04-03 02:00:00

excellent hotel and so much better than the usual hotel chains location: just off the n22 and very well placed for ring of kerry and further onto dingle peninsula parking: big free parking lot which is a big bonus rooms: well appointed and adequate. there is a touch of colonial look which is always welcome restaurant: menu obviously curtailed due to covid but otherwise excellent. breakfast: good value and recommended impression: very good value for money and highly recommended. one word for the staff: smiling and always helpful. no much better than the dead pan chain hotel staff. guys keep it up! nothing really. well done!|4.5|2021-09-25 02:00:00
my daughter summed it up 'everything cheap except the prices!' management welcome was poor bordering on the hostile & surly. staff generally cheerful & pleasant but clearly inexperienced, lacking training and proper management. made allowances for the fact that this is a fairly new opening but at their prices the food offering needs to be a lot better than it is. we will go back but much improvement is needed.|1.0|2021-06-19 13:26:00

staff were v friendly and helpful. outdoor bar area was lovely (we got excellent weather which of course was a bonus). breakfast was delicious. room was just right. view is spectacular. lovely walks etc from the hotel. excellent facilities - i saw bikes etc. although we did not need them on this stay. no noise at night. warm, friendly atmosphere. family atmosphere - plenty of families around but every place was calm and appropriate. golf, of course, although we did not avail. i am sure it would be lovely for anyone who plays. i didn't need to make teacoffee as it turned out but if i did i would have like a little packet of biscuits. sometimes when staying in a hotel, one feels far from a shop and if one needs a snack..|4.5|2021-07-03 02:00:00
"dinner was a circus. after begging someone to help us get seated it was another 30 minutes before we saw a server to place an order. 2 hours before dinner was served.
it was the worst meal i have ever had, hands down. the fairmont is so over booked and underserved with staff that it was easier to keep the table, have my husband walk down the street and order dinner and bring it back to the table which had the same warm drinks sitting on them and still no sushi's. the server, when we saw him, was apologetic but it never changed our meal (which was still served 2 hours after ordering) and our service never got better. it was a huge waste of time and money and we should have left immediately. rice was gummy on the sushi and the roll tasted like a publix grocery store roll, and it may have been. in general don't eat at the fairmont, stay at the fairmont or even swim at the fairmont. it's all gross."|1.0|2022-01-02 15:05:00

in contrast, we went to the hotel lobby and the staff there helped us get desserts for take away - incredibly polite and helpful, loved them!"|3.0|2021-11-27 23:39:00

quality of high tea items need to be improved. the cinnamon roll was too dry. the sandwiches were dry too. should have at least 2 drinks selection instead of restricting just to 1 drink. the cost of 1 tea to the hotel is not much but yet enhances the overall experience. compared to other high teas across other hotels, which are of the same price, they offer minimally 2 drinks or free flow. even if it's free flow, how much can 1 person drink within the 2 hours. however the dining experience is greatly enhanced.|2.0|2021-12-12 06:16:00

the only problem with cedar creek is they produce a menu for n.y.eve which has nothing to do with their regular menu on their website. items are limited and the prices are outrageous ($60 for salmon, same for lamb, etc) which do not include an appetizer ($19) or dessert. the food is great, but the prices must be quite a surprise for first-timers. i suggest that when reservations are made, customers should be told about this special menu.|4.0|2022-01-02 04:51:00

"we were looking for a good lunch spot downtown. sadly, this won't be it.
the food was truly delish, unless it wasn't. of the 3 of us, one had the grilled cheese and soup - perfection. one had the market plate with chicken, fries and roasted broccoli. the chicken & fries: excellent. the broccoli: charred on the outside, hard in the middle. i had the market plate with salmon, mac&chs & bacon&blue brussels. the salmon: superb. the mac&chs: good. i'd have it again. the brussels: no blue in sight, hard in the middle and covered in too much vinegar.
the atmosphere: the website does a good job of making it look larger and more comfy than it really is. expect a multi-purpose diner. not uncomfortable, but not someplace you want to really spend time, either. and surprisingly loud. very echo-y.
the service: the hostess was awesome. cheerful, on it. the server was less so. not rude, just not *there* either. rarely saw her throughout the meal. but what really got to us was something that happened at another table. the two guests accidentally knocked over one of their beers. it spilled all over their table and the floor by them. not one server came to help. multiple servers - including ours - walked by, looked at it and kept going. no one offered to wipe down their now sticky table, or the floor. they had to go fetch linen napkins from another table to handle it themselves. even more: their server and a runner form the kitchen brought out their meals, were told about the incident, served their food over the mess on the floor and never came back to clean it up. having served and cooked in a number of restaurants over the years, i was offended for the couple at this display of just not giving a d*mn.
the food was good. if we ever stay in the hotel for any reason, i'd eat there. but living in cle, this wont be the place we go for lunch downtown."|4.0|2021-07-28 19:39:00

i ordered the bblt (bacon bacon bacon lettuce tomato) -- it was okay. it's a big sandwich with a lot of bread and bacon, but i wouldn't order it again. my companion ordered biscuits and gravy and she said it was delicious. we were never asked if we wanted dessert, and honestly, if we had been asked, we probably would have ordered some. my biggest surprise came when they said they don't validate for parking, so that essentially added another $25 to our bill. i won't be back.|4.0|2022-03-10 01:31:00

"you arrive through a stunning hotel lobby, greeted by the concierge. you are expecting good things, however it all went downhill from there. we were seated in the terrace which looked nothing like the photos and did not match the opulence of the reception. instead we were shown to a table in what looked like a car park lit by a stark white clinical light source. i would be willing to forgive the surroundings if the rest of the experience was excellent but sadly it was not. the service while not terrible was also not great it took a while for food to come out and it didn't feel special. the food was very average. i had the crab starter and the monkfish curry. the curry was bland and the crab was ok but nothing incredible and disappointing at the price point. the only thing that we were really impressed with was the wine which was very nice.
overall i would say that the main problem was just that the price did not match the quality. my review would read very differently if we were paying 35 per head and in a pub but paying 70 and being in somewhere attempting fine dining i would say that this was very disappointing."|1.0|2021-06-14 21:06:00

this was our best meal of the week in hawaii. i'm the foodie of our family and you won't go wrong here. first to sit right on the water and have that view was spectacular. get there for a 5:45 reservation and watch the sun drop. i ordered the foie gras as an appetizer (seared to perfection with and interesting granola prep on the side and a plum sauce). next was my lobster salad (light and delicious-could've had a few more chunks of lobster.). our friends ordered the lobster tempura and it looked better. had the chicken bc i was getting tired of fish and it was also very good. hubby got the caesar salad and macadamia crusted mahi mahi. he said it was great. he ordered the strawberry shortcake which was light and fluffy. the calories from the mai tai were my dessert i figured. it was amazing. we thought our meal at meridia at our hotel was good until we ate here. manta has them beat by a long shot!|5.0|2021-11-18 08:31:00

the place has changed owners and totally different than a few years ago. last time i was there it was a fancy place with great food. now the place is a dive. outside maybe a good family place but inside is very casual with a very limited menu. service super slow but it maybe due to covid issues and not enough staff. the food tasted ok but desert was terrible with stale cake. the place was so cold insidethey had the fire escape door wide open with outside temperature in the 30s. very uncomfortable eating dinner with your coat on. not an experience i would ever want to repeat!|2.0|2021-11-07 15:31:00

there was a glass door with no blind backing on to the car park of our ground floor room. i was charged for car parking at castle hotel. there is a question about parking charges. eccles townhouse who made the original booking have clarified that a charge is payable and i accept that. but i want to make the point that it's a bit imprecise in the listings for both eccles th and castle hotel, where the parking is and how much a night (unless i have missed something). i think such info is important when making a booking. location (in castle hotel, as eccles closed) was good for mater private hospital. staff were very pleasant. a good dinner. couldn't comment on the breakfast as i was fasting for an operation. my wife enjoyed the scrambled egg. i liked the old style decor. as it is a set of houses linked together one needs to look out for steps and ramps up and down but everything is well signed. there are lifts to the higher floors. stayed in march 2021|3.5|2021-03-30 01:00:00

i tried to book a table using open table. there was only 5:00 or 8:00 pm available. i tried to call for a table but couldn't get past the answering machine which promised to call within 48 hrs. we ate at 5:00 but the facility was never close to being full. i asked the receptionist what i had such a hard time getting a table and she seemed extremely unconcerned with my problems. there are too many other places around with better food and available seating.|2.0|2021-06-05 21:51:00
would be brill for someone looking for a party weekend. for me who wanted a nights sleep, it was the worst place to stay. i contacted the reception 2+ times and was told that other rooms would be just as loud and it's just the bank holiday weekend. devastated i paid 80 for no sleep for a night. staff were friendly but there was nothing they could do, just very bad building for noise. lots of street noise, unable to sleep and was running a 12 marathon the next day. this was due to a concert in the hotel and people hanging outside after. worst night sleep in any hotel i've had. reception didn't do anything about it, said it would be just as bad in another room, despite me calling the reception on 2 occasions. rubbish in room behind bin from previous occupant.|1.0|2022-05-24 02:00:00

great atmosphere and friendly staff. the food itself was large portion wise and generally tasted good, but there were a few uneven aspects to the meal. the 'lightly breaded' fish was heavily breaded to the point of maybe a 5050 ratio. the sauce for the ribs was a bit on the salty side. overall though the location and food are fantastic.|5.0|2021-10-22 15:48:00

i loved the cleanness of the room and also the small things that should be obvious in a hotel, but in some places, they are not. for example, the air vent was great in the bathroom, there was a toilet brush and the soap was liquid in a pump tube bottle (as opposed to packaged soap which i don't prefer). also, the balcony is great and the view is very nice! the bar staff is not well trained. they are very lovely, but they don't walk around looking for the customers' attention if they want something. i actually had to walk to the bar to order. also, i was deeply disappointed by the paid parking. on booking.com it says there is parking. it's true that i didn't check whether it was free or not, i just automatically supposed that it was free. it's not. there is parking, but it doesn't belong to the hotel and there is a 50% discount if you stay there, but i still think it should be free.|4.5|2021-10-07 02:00:00

"the food was outstanding! but the decor and the ambience were distinctly at odds with the quality of the food - bright lights, no candles, no background music & no way to isolate the business group next door who (whilst not overly noisy) drowned out the rest of the restaurant as there was no background music.
sadly, the stately house has become quite pedestrian (apart from the food! - thanks chef!)"|2.0|2021-10-01 02:48:00

"food service drink was all wonderful, the ambience there is very relaxing and upscale.
i've been coming to this restaurant for years and now, maybe slow down in business, due to the pandemic, they charge a 4% fee for using a credit card. if their costs have gone up they should not pass that along to the consumer.
that is very tacky for an upscale restaurant.
i made the reservation on open table and i did not see that included as information maybe it was.
the restaurant was not very busy as it was only a monday night. they should be giving me a 4% break in our bill for patronizing. charges on atms aren't even that high.
if anything it should be a flat fee not a percent of your bill as ours was quite high. i am assuming if the bank does charge them a fee for processing credit cards it is per purchase not based on the dollar amount of the bill.
maybe time to find a new place for calamari appetizer, prime rib, brie stuffed chicken breast and delicious creme brulee. we
and delicious desserts.
it was annoying enough i may have to find a new favorite restaurant"|3.0|2021-09-29 04:55:00

"as the manager put it as an ""oversight"", the server forgot to ring in all of our food- for over an hour. we watched every table sat after as recieve bread, salad, entrees, etc as we sat there. even more insulting, our server asked us as at the 40 minute mark if we received our food yet, when clearly we did not. the first item to reach the table was an appetizer that was not for our table- which they picked up and brought to the right table. don't worry, even taking covid out of the equation, someone else's food sitting in on the wrong table for an undisclosed amount of time then not discarded is concerning within itself. a dining experience lasting over 2 hours as manager and a plethora of staff members gawked at as and referred to us at the ""corner table"" with no food was embarrassing. even added to the ""experience"" was hearing the team members fighting in the kitchen. our server asked another server for assistance with an ice bucket and his response was ""no time"" and walked away. i am unclear what is more embarrassing, the manager and staff at the establishment or ourselves for not walking out and leaving such a horrifying experience. just to add insult to injury, we were celebrating our 12 year wedding anniversary."|1.0|2021-09-18 15:24:00

i had high hopes. same-day booking for dinner not possible. so i booked lunch. on a monday. epic fail. after sitting 25 at the table and speaking to three different staffers (one server and two i don't know what but not qualified servers), i got up from the table and went back to the hostess. she wasn't at her station at the moment, but wasn't far away. i told her our table seemed to be in a dead zone (ie, invisible to staff and not on the radar), and that the staffers puttering around didn't know wth they were doing. she apologized. i wasn't satisfied, but returned to the table as the drinks were arriving. 12:30 pm, noon reservation, 30% occupancy rate. lunch. effectively downhill from there. assuming that fine dining is part of the #serviceindustry (the restaurant is inside an expensive boutique hotel), it's a fail. my advice to every restaurant owner and manager is this: if you can't staff the tables, don't book the tables.|2.0|2022-02-21 23:06:00

i do like this hotel we have been staying in it every year at christmas for over 10 years now it's in a prime location of the town there was no hot water for our showers and only today before we left i noticed the mattress on our bed was full of black mill due i nearly got sick also if your not down for breakfast at 7 in the morning you will most definitely end up wit a cold breakfast and we also found the household staff very rude talking loudly on there own language and not even as much as a hello|2.0|2022-12-04 01:00:00

did not see where to order for room service until i was leaving. was expecting the usual flyer on the dresser. didn't think to look elsewhere but understand why there was no sheet due to covid. also, i was coming out the door, quite visible to the shuttle's driver, when he pulled away. passengers could be instructed that the bus pulls around and they can catch it at the corner as it goes out. the bed was so comfy, i didn't bother going down for supper. stayed in december 2020|4.5|2021-01-06 00:00:00

the hotel itself is visually beautiful, the food and drink were amazing, easily accessible to both spike island and fota wildlife but what really made the experience for us was the staff who were absolutely amazing- from the minute we walked into the resort until we left all our needs were more than catered for. the attention to detail is second to none and every staff member we encountered were friendly, enthusiastic and more than willing to help. we cannot wait to return. honestly nothing|5.0|2021-10-27 02:00:00
unfortunately we had an inexperienced waiter. but floor supervisor ashley came to rescue. we will ask for her again. best items: combination hummus great. best ever and enough for 4 or more. tuna tacos was ok. cocktails great. spicy mussels and clams too spicy for me. lobster roll excellent but a little too much mayonnaise. burger first class. all french fries arrived lukewarm but were replaced. finish with strawberry home made shortcake was excellent and enough to share by three adults. we will definitely try again. by the way beautiful outdoor seating|4.0|2021-09-11 17:44:00

we had reservations and were seated immediately. dining area was empty except for us after several minutes another couple was seated a few tables away from ours. the waitress came in, walked past our table, went to the other couple and greeted them. after finally coming to our table she took our drink order. we placed our order and the food came out fairly quickly. my wife's salmon was raw in the middle and my skirt steak was barely warm. we informed the waitress and she thanked us for letting her know, she did offer to warm up my steak but she really could have cared less and offered no resolution for the salmon. we asked for our check, paid and left. we will not ever be returning to dine at this establishment!|1.0|2021-09-18 20:15:00

nothing is good! service! this is the worst four-star hotel ever! i don't know why it rated so high. the usual bottles of water and slippers were absent, and no one came to clean the room the next day! when i got home, i found i had left my jacket in my room. i called many times, sent 3 emails, and finally after a week and half, i got a simple reply that they couldn't find my jacket! the day i left, the cleaner was just outside my door and i wonder how my jacket got lost in a four-star hotel! i wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone, and i definitely wouldn't go there again!|0.5|2021-07-23 02:00:00
the tables are very close together- not a lot of space for sitting. the menu has maybe 4 categories- salad, burgers, flatbread, and kids. then there are maybe 3 options for each of those. the food took a while to get to us. it tasted alright. then the check took a while to come as well as the return of our card.|3.0|2021-12-13 17:22:00

"situated in the lobby of the chic and stylish hyatt place hotel, ema's natural vibes of wood and greenery foster and airy atmosphere welcoming enough to relax even the most formal diners. everyone at ema was there to have fun, and the hip pumping bass playlist interspersed itself with energetic conversation.
now for the food. mediterranean cuisine focuses on fresh, simple flavors like lemon, garlic, and sesame. ema took the art form to its highest level. i can honestly say i have never tasted better mediterranean food in my life, nor have i had a better meal downtown.
the eggplant spread comes served with warm and irresistible pita bread, toasted to perfection and sprinkled with persian spices. the cauliflower is artistically plated with greek yogurt and a subtle touch of honey to complement the fresh crunch of vegetable.
emma's house specialty--the brussel sprouts--are sweetly glazed, charred, and tossed with pumpkin seeds. most everyone has eaten brussel sprouts before, but you have never tasted them like this.
i quite recommend the mushroom kabob for the rich grilled portobellos and pungent, pesto-like sauce served on the side. i would love to ask chef cj jacobson where the syrupy, date-and-fig-like flavor on this dish came from.
for carnivores, the beef kabob is seasoned generously with what tasted like turmeric, parsley, and onion--just like a traditional middle eastern kofta grill of meat. but save room for dessert! the honey pie (see picture attached) is handsomely presented with a dollop of home-made whipped cream, sweet candied red grapes (which were addictive; i could have eaten a whole bowl of those alone), and a garnish of sesame seeds. the dish was every bit as sweet and satisfying as it sounds.
the staff here are very friendly, and service is quick. as for me, i have found my new favorite place to eat in chicago and--god-willing--look forward to making many more special memories in this impeccable mediterranean restaurant."|5.0|2022-03-06 19:38:00

"food was 5 star. i recommend the ahi credit and the churros for desert.the waiter john who was on his second day was outstanding! the cocktails costing $24 for a routine hendricks martini was ridiculous. parking was a hot mess. no way to see where the gate was for parking. no signs indicating parking for meridia was behind a gate. had to take a card ($3.00 per hour). told we had to get it validated at front desk for westin check in with our bill. but upon eventually finding our way through the maze, we got parking validated at the hostess desk. leaving was not easy. the validated ticket was not going into the reader. the speaker to contact someone rang incessantly with no help from anyone. finally a smart aleck valet came out to retrieve a car. he saw my distress and yelled at me to get closer?? i was so close i had no problem sticking my card in slot, the machine did not work. he then clicked his remote and gate opened. ruined the entire $300 evening (for two). no clear markings where to park, the ""validation process"" was ridiculous. honestly, i will not be back. too bad, the food and service were great. but if westin wishes to have people pay $30 a day to park for a hotel stay and $3 an hour for other guests, they should just open the lot for meridia diners at 5 pm and close it at 10 pm. nobody is going to that secluded, hard to find hotel in the evening that is not a hotel guest or trying to locate the restaurant for dining. once in the parking garage, the elevators do not provide any instructions as to where meridia is located. it took quite a few twists and turns, ups and downs to get to the open area in hotel where there was a sign for meridia. call me when you have solved the parking issues otherwise there are just a delicious and less expensive restaurants on the big island that welcome their guests."|3.0|2021-10-14 07:58:00

not a very warm place and of course very gloomy so did not make for a great atmosphere, but if you like really old places and smelly wood burning fires you will love it. found the food acceptable but rather bland with not a lot of flavour, we went on a sunday and had two roasts which were not hot, but they were very apologetic and replaced them with hot meals which were much better. my daughter had the beef which was a bit too rare.|2.0|2022-02-15 13:11:00

i don't typically give reviews, but in this case i wanted to share mine andy families experience last night. first, i understand fully that do to the pandemic it's been hard to find help and fully staff many areas, so slower than normal service can be expected at times but the staff is still polite and professional. so when my food finally arrived it was cold, now i can deal with warm food especially after being out in the park all day but my new york steak was cold, and funny enough my proof was that the pat of garlic butter was still in perfect shape on top of the steak, dead give away. i cut a piece anyway to try it and to my surprise it tasted great, and perfectly cooked to medrare. here is where the important part of review comes in the play, the server can by to check on everything and it was all good but me and when i said my steak was cold she looked and noticed immediately how i could tell, without having to ask much at all she took it reheat and when it came back it was perfect and they added more veggies as well. the service recovery here is why i'm writing this review. in a restaurant that was busy and full of tired parents and fussy kids the staff took the time to check on us frequently and took care of us with a smile and lastly offered a discount for the issue. i'm big on how a business fixes a problemore so than having the problem, accidents and miscommunication can happen anytime but it's how the staff respond to and address the problem that i look for, how well they do speaks to how well the management pick staff and train them and for me the entire restaurant experience here was great and the food was very good. i wish i could thank my server by name here but i forgot it, but i want her to know how well she represented her restaurant and made us want to come back again. i highly recommend this restaurant for the food and the staff. first trip to legoland was awesome!|5.0|2021-10-17 20:14:00

we were a party of six on a saturday night - castleton students and parents for dinner during homecoming weekend. the outdoor seating was terrific, especially during covid times. our server hustled and despite a backup in the kitchen that caused a little bit of a slow down, we enjoyed our apps and meals and the general ambience. great food and great company. we were a bit boisterous, and it seemed just fine given the vibe of the place with live music and a firepit. great spot for a beverage and meal!|4.0|2021-09-19 21:27:00
the location was good and staff at reception were helpful. menu selection in all restaurants was poor (similar options in all locations) and the food was only fair. the seafood tagliatelle was simply pasta with a spoonful of seafood chowder added - this was apparent as i had the chowder for lunch. hotel seemed a little drab and dated in comparison to photos on the website.|2.0|2021-06-07 02:00:00

room was quite loud facing the port behind the hotel and the ac was loud as well but did not affect our sleeping. location was great. breakfast was good but would have liked to se individual tongs to pick up food to minimize risk cross contamination the staff was great, the covid seal on the room was nice to have. cleanliness of the common part of the hotel might be better, out side next room was cutlery for 3 days the carpet on the stairway might have been vacuumed more often|4.0|2021-12-02 01:00:00
"there's still a way to go with the food and service at the newly reopened pub. it's great to see it operating again and freshly painted.
the ploughmans had by two of us was disappointing. it was trying to be fancy, which is ok, but the amount served for 13.50 was measly. just one piece of bread and one small piece of cheese (it was local cheese but to be honest i'm not sure most people would really care so long as it was nice), plus half a gherkin, a few halves silver-skin onions, a small pot of ham hock pate, a small portion of celeriac remoulade, a tablespoon of pickle, and some watercress. i'm glad i'm not a ploughman as i would not have been able to do another furrow on those rations.
my other friend's 14 ham and chicken pie was fine, if rather lacking in chicken, but the asparagus served alongside was limp. there were no other accompaniments.
neither dish was what you would call good value or memorable.
the serving staff, one in particular, need training in how to talk to customers. rather abrupt, no hint of a welcome, absolutely no warmth or friendliness. the cutlery and litter under the table when i sat down (outside) was inexcusable as it should have been removed by staff when they cleared the table. the trouble with little sachets of condiments is that they end up on the ground.
i will be going again as it's my local and i want to support it. this is intended to be constructive so i hope the new landlord will take it as such."|2.0|2021-06-04 13:09:00
lounge and restaurant the heating was too high for the time we went october early november has been really mild and it was hard to sleep as the rooms and all throughout the hotel was v warm. we slept with both curtains and windows open so this ruined my stay. also my chicken burger from the restaurant was really tough and over cooked so another thing that kind of ruined my stay this time. i've stayed before and loved every minute but this time was a little disappointing.|3.5|2022-11-16 01:00:00

"legoland forces you to use open table to get a reservation to eat breakfast, which i did and in the explanation of the reservation are the words"" complimentary for hotel guests"" but what it does not say is if you are staying at the other legoland hotel your breakfast is not complimentary. it was a rip off. the worst thing is the hotel i was staying in had no availability on this day. so what is a guest to do? you've already paid an absorbent amount for a complimntary breakfast for 4. oy the be gouged for another $80.00 because legoland and open table don't have their stuff together. how about a simple notice in your welcome packet?"|2.0|2022-03-25 22:04:00

great room, bed was massive and very comfortable. complimentary chocolates are a nice touch. poor service, both at dinner in amber lounge and at breakfast. upon arrival at the property, there was no concierge and no reception staff at any desk. i did manage to check in with a man who failed to inform us of breakfastcheck out times, tell us where breakfast is held and did nothing more than hand us the key and point me towards the lift. had to queue for more than 5 minutes to be allowed in for breakfast, and upon entering, realised that only 8 tables were occupied and the room almost empty. no sausages on arrival at breakfast, waited approximately 30minutes for toast which arrived long after i had finished my actual meal. waiting time of at least 10 minutes for drinks in the bar. had to ask for a bottle of table water, even though our wine glasses had been switched with water glasses 15 minutes previous. we ordered mains and dessert, but were left with the starter knives and forks to eat our mains. we also visited the thermal suite where the staff were extremely nice, but were insistent of us buying swimming hats, where on entering the pool we were greeted with 3 older ladies in the pool, none of them wearing a swimming hat. also a lot of the buttons for the facilities in the pool were not workingbroken. extremely poor experience for what we hoped would be a great way to celebrate a special day.|2.5|2022-11-20 01:00:00

the breakfast was good and the staff friendly. the room we were in was so loud. music was blaring all day and into the late hours of the morning which meant we could hardly sleep as the hotel is on the loudest road in dublin in terms of bars and clubs. it was also boiling - our window was broken and wouldn't open fully meaning we had to prop it open with the bin. it also made the noise worse but it was simply too hot in the room not to and there was no air con. our room was serviced once and it was very disappointing. the sheets weren't changed and we'd been there 2 nights by this point, i'd even taken the pillow case off one of the pillows in anticipation of the sheet change as it needed changing. the bathroom floor wasn't cleaned and toiletries weren't replaced.|2.0|2022-07-17 02:00:00

my family of 4 was enjoying a nice meal together before my older son went back to college. the restaurant itself was lovely, open and airy looking out to the city lights. the decor is lacking a bit and was too plain and not befitting an upscale french restaurant at the ritz hotel. however, it was nice and quiet and the service was excellent. the food was not as impressive as it should be for the price. the menu only allowed 3 choices (including the dessert) for $90 and each additional choice was $30 more, with some of the existing choices already needing a supplemental price. i'm willing to pay for that but the food has to be almost perfect. also, there were so few selections. it seemed like the menu had been pared down. my grenouille (frog) was a bit too salty and needed a bit more salad and sauce. the chicken en croute was also too salty and the escargot was over cooked and rubbery. the duck was not as soft as could be either. the 3 different kinds of bread were nothing special and could have been from any plain bakery. the 2 mock tails my kids ordered were tiny and were $11 each. i don't think it was even 8oz. overall, it was not an impressive meal. nothing was bad, but nothing was amazing either. $500 for a dinner for 4 with no alcohol should be a bit more fabulous.|3.0|2022-01-16 22:54:00

"pros: most fellow staff members are great to work with and hard working (except for a select few) a lovely place to work at, with a beautiful lobby. super convenient location for both guests and employees as it is in the middle of the city. cons:low wage and false promises of career advancement in the hotel. no staff meal on the daily. severely understaffed and overworked at times. personally had to do multiple jobs in 1 position and not get compensated properly. feeling underappreciated and undermined. (was told to ""slow down and chill out"" when asking regarding career advancement.) actually listen to your fellow entry workers and make things happen for them, it doesn't have to be everything. if they're looking for career advancements then guide them and create a program that might be suitable for them. without entry level workers the hotels won't be operational, so make sure that your turnover rate is low and keep the staff morale high."|3.0|2022-11-12 08:42:00

aesthetics, 10010. gorgeous and very instagram worthy decor.
my honest opinion is that living in houston, we are so used to the brunch menu being the only menu during that timeframe. that's not the case in dc but we weren't informed of this until after this board came out. in which it was ok and not filling at all.
the espresso martini was amazing! 1010

location is great, building is beautiful, beds comfortable. food for a breakfast was tasty, although selection wasn't big. our bathroom wasn't cleaned properly. there was a big bottle of toilet fresher on the side of bath behind bath curtains. bath was dirty, shower-head stained. in order to take it in hands pulished it myself and washed a bath too. one of the hand towels seemed to be used. luckily there was trolley with linen in corridor, so we got a fresh towel from there (we arrived after 8:30 pm). breakfast staff was unwelcoming. when we arrived at breakfast, room wasn't busy - just a table of 4 or 6 and 2 of us. there wasn't hostess at the desk, noone explained a system for breakfast (order at buffet, sit at the table and wait to be served?). once asked a lady behind buffet, didn't get any explanation, but we got a food and weird looks from the staff. picked up cutlery and tissues from the service station myself. if asked stuff for anything more, felt like we are troubling them. despite of that food tasted well.|3.0|2021-10-31 02:00:00

the property had parking which was a plus and it was on a bus line to the city centre. the room we stayed in was right next to the back entrance of the hotel, it was very noisy having people come in and out of this entrance late at night and early in the morning which made it difficult to sleep. we stayed for 2 nights and both nights it was hard to sleep and very noisy.|2.0|2021-08-24 02:00:00
we noted however, that the master bedroom could be a bit warm, as central heating timing was set both by the hotel and by the guests themselves. this was easily remedied by keeping the windows slightly open for a few hours. there were some hours that central heating was turned on even though we turned it off from our end. the smaller room overlooked the central courtyard, and was noisy for the last night as someone may have had a celebration downstairs. the living room was by far the room that had the most noise from many vehicles passing by the main street. bedroom was on the first floor, with master bedroom overlooking the main street. the property was spacious, with all amenities (towels, toiletries, etc.) provided for. the kitchen was fully furnished, and we quite enjoyed the cosy living room. master bedroom windows were double glazed, thus noise was less of an issue. stayed in december 2020|5.0|2021-01-01 00:00:00

very highly rated place. didn't realize it was in a hotel lobby. food was good, but nothing mind blowing - although the thick spaghetti special was phenomenal. our server was from austin - very knowledgeable - and a truly local guy. enjoyable dinner and experience, but would never come back here again.|3.0|2021-11-07 21:47:00
the bed was very comfortable, we slept great while we were there. if you are looking to be in the center of the action, in a party area the location is perfect - within walking distance to just about everything. the balcony was great for the morning coffee. the hotel bar was one of the best hotel bars i've been to. the bartender steven was the first person we really talked to while we were in dublin and he was just an absolute delight. the water pressure was a bit weak. the size of the room was a bit claustrophobic. it was nice for a three day stay but anything more than that may have been a bit cramped. the hotel breakfast was fine but i dont think it was worth 15 euro.|3.5|2022-06-10 02:00:00

don't book a table outside of you plan on having dinner. even though the rooftop garden is amazing; there are really only cocktail tables out there which are not appropriate for a full meal. my party had done just that and opted to to actually eat inside. other than that the service was extremely attentive and the food very good and nice pleasant and modern surroundings. take notice of all the unique artwork around the hotel it's a very nice space.|4.0|2021-03-30 00:36:00
the whole hotel was very cold. corridors were unheated and very cold during my stay. the bedroom is heated with a direct acting wall mounted electric heater which is inadequate. the room was also quite cold but when heating in on for a long period it became to hot. once heat was turned off, room lost heat immediately. inadequate heating system and impossibe to maintain a comfortable level. draught from window, strong enough to constantly move curtains through the night. bed comfortable, linen good quality stayed in december 2020|2.5|2021-01-04 00:00:00
location perfect , very central . breakfast was lovely . room very clean and comfy . our three rooms were all close to each other which was great . our rooms were a long way from lifts which was ok except our room cards were constantly not working and we had to go all the way back to lift and then down to reception to get them replaced . had to keep moving the tea coffee making facilities around as sockets weren't working in room|3.5|2022-04-07 02:00:00
absolutely first class. lovely staff, the ambience portrayed the historical connection with burns. our meal was top notch, wonderful flavours, beautiful presentation, we were in culinary heaven! a thoroughly fabulous evening. the chef came into tte dining room at the end of service and his passion and commitment was evident.|5.0|2021-09-26 22:10:00
food and drink ok 1) reception staff were unhelpful. we had a lot of luggage and they had no porter on duty so were just left to do it ourselves. the 2 men in the party both had heart conditions. for what we were paying and and what we were led to believe was a luxury hotel, not to have a porter was unacceptable. the duty manager lent a had whilst the staff sat around idly. we thanked him for his help and suggested he might learn to delegate. all in our party are business owners for many years and it was clear that it was a hotel run by the staff for the staff. 2) no air conditioning - the room was like a furnace when we checked in!!|2.0|2022-07-19 02:00:00

we stayed at legoland's castle hotel this past week. we dined at the dragon's den for breakfast the whole time we were there, twice for dinner, and once for lunch. the staff were all very friendly, albeit, seemingly understaffed. there was a longer than normal wait for refills, etc. the food was fantastic. and the reservation website was easy to use. i would recommend this restaurant if you're staying at the hotel. it was comparable in prices to anywhere else you'd go and conveniently located within your hotel.|4.0|2022-03-28 22:43:00

"i've been to the inn numerous times and had a lovely meal and the service was amazing. it was my birthday so i brought my family (5 adults, 2 children) and it's a shame to say we did not have a good experience.
when we walked in, it took forever to take our drinks order.
we ordered our food and my sister ordered seafood moules, they came as white wine moules, she questioned this with the waitress who stated the seafood is there (she checked, it wasn't), she then raised this with someone else who said he would check with the chef, he never came back, she raised this a third time with the waitress who took our order and she accused my sister of ordering the wrong dish and she didn't order seafood which was not acceptable service; so we had to call on someone else, again and finally it got changed. to have to ask 4 times that it's the wrong dish and for it to be changed is not an acceptable service.
we then felt we had to call upon waitresseswaiters constantly as we felt they were avoiding our table.
finally we got our plates cleared and not once did we get offered a dessert menu, we had to ask. we finally ordered and when the puddings came out we had no cutlery so yet again, we had to ask. the waiter then came back with teaspoons, not dessert spoons so we had to wait again to ask someone to change this.
we had 2 small children under the age of 4 and a nice birthday lunch turned into 3 hours of having to constantly ask throughout the meal for different things which is not acceptable.
i'm very sad to write this as i love coming to the inn however it's embarrassing when you bring your family and this is the experience you receive.
on a positive note, the food was amazing and faultless. we all enjoyed the food we received! 5 stars!"|2.0|2021-12-14 09:58:00

our room was lovely but there wasn't any shower gels shampoos anything so we had to drive into cavan town and buy some from dunnes stores after just checking in as driving from limerick to cavan is a long drive so we just wanted to have a shower. then our first night out for dinner our waitress taking our orders was called sarah, she introduced herself lovely and explained she would be our waitress for the night to only take our order and not come near the table for the rest of the night. we ordered two cocktails before our starters which we didn't received until our main course which our main course arrived a hour after our starters and was only warm wasn't hot, i asked for extra gravy for it to come out cold. we spoke to a really nice man called john i think he was so nice and asked if we would like anything complimentary but we explained no we're totally fine we work in kitchens too so we just wanted to let the chefs know. then for breakfast our toast and coffee came out once we had our breakfast finished we thought it was just because it's 10:15 a busy time so changed our breakfast to 8:15 the following morning and the same thing happened. we ordered toast and coffee and waited for that to arrived before getting our hot breakfast, the waiter brought down the coffee and plain bread for my partner so we thought lovely the toast will be here next so went to get our hot food and only to be waiting 15 minutes for toast, watching him and other waitresses give toast to tables just arriving. our bedroom wasn't touched by housekeeping over the two days, no new towels no toiletries nothing. our second night of dinner was in the ceder rooms and it was beautiful! our main course was taking extra time as they were busy but we were giving a lovely sorbet in the middle to pass some time. the staff were amazing and so friendly! really made our night, especially the gentleman named shane! overall wouldn't recommend to anyone to stay maybe just a day visit to the spa.. the one thing that we really liked was the spa and swimming pool. the staff in the spa were so nice and approachable. we both got a treatment done mine was off a lady called melissa and my partners was off a young man he never got the name of and they were both so nice! stayed in june 2021|2.5|2021-06-12 01:00:00

our food was distasteful. i got the adobo braised short rib. i will say the short rib meat was good but the fried rice did not taste like fried rice and the other sides weren't flavorful. my boyfriend got the jidori 12 chicken and he also said the same thing. he really only tasted and liked the chicken the the potato, the rest that came with that plate didn't have much flavor. i will say the ambience and service was phenomenal. loved the aesthetics of it, just wouldn't recommend the food. definitely stop by the treehouse for drinks!|3.0|2022-02-20 20:23:00

we have been here before but food quality has gone down a lot. ordered a french onion soup bowl- not served wit cheese covering the bowl and one tiny crouton in the middle of a big bowl of peppery soup. we sent it back. ordered coconut shrimp app instead- shrimp overcooked and sauces were yucky, but i don't like to complain about the food more than once in a meal. i figure at that point it just is what it is. short rib dinners for both of us - meat was lacking flavor and honestly tasted kinda . like what i imagine dog food tastes like. potatoes and veggies were ok. coconut cake for dessert was good. felt like it was super overpriced for the quality. was very disappointed.|1.0|2021-12-29 22:57:00

"food was ok but the menu seemed quite limited at lunch time, unfortunately they couldn't find our booking despite us having received a booking confirmation on open table.
apparently the restaurants ipad which has the open table app wasn't to hand and possibly hadn't been checked to add digital bookings to the reservation book.
luckily the restaurant was empty so we were able to eat, but we could have easily been turned away had this not been the case."|3.0|2021-11-03 19:58:00
what sold this hotel is the staff ..having stayed in 4 hotels in last 6 wks the staff at shannon springs were above and beyond the other 3 hotels i have been at. they are definitely 10 out of 10 only suggestion i have is the bed rooms are a little dated ..if they received a make over i would rate the whole hotel a 10 out of 10|4.5|2021-08-10 02:00:00

the staff everywhere in the hotel could not do enough for you! they were friendly and professional, even though some of them were new & only learning in times of social distancing and restrictions. the food in the bar was delicious and arrived speedily once ordered. our family room was a great size and clean. we phoned ahead a couple of hours prior to checking in time, house keeping were just finishing off our room so we were able to check in early. we thought the breakfast was a bit of a let down and not good value for money. very limited choice of cereals, breads fruits etc. it also had to be paid for in reception prior to ordering which i thought a bit juvenile, why not pay when finished like our evening meals? although the food did taste nice and was well cooked, the staff were very attentive and our orders arrived quickly. the corridors were busy and very noisy on the saturday night- this is not the hotels fault as i think people were gathering in rooms rather than the bar.|4.5|2021-07-06 02:00:00

"we ate here while on our family vacation. the hotel is very nice but the actual ""restaurant"" is in the lobby adjacent to the bar area. when we arrived there were no other tables with customers. the music was exceptionally loud (even my two college age daughters commented as to the noise level). when we asked the hostess if they could lower the music she said ""i can't hear you"" so we repeated our request. we were told that the manager wouldn't be happy with that request. after asking several times, the begrudgingly lowered the music. while our waiter was good the entire experience from a service perspective was poor at best. the food was above average except for the fact that it markets itself as a ""sushi"" restaurant but there were out of tuna, salmon and yellowtail - yes - hard to believe. another odd policy is that they take your credit card when you place your order - not something i have seen from other restaurants in puerto rico. again, our waiter was very good but the rest of the service left a lot to be desired and made for a pretty unpleasant experience."|2.0|2021-12-30 02:50:00

"i've never enjoyed the restaurant's choice of music, but this visit it was particularly bad, and much louder. the play list was what you might expect at a sports bar. the new gm may want to consider a playlist from hotel costes, (spotify) music was so loud it was hard to hear the conversation of the guests at our table. food was mediocre at best for the price, and service we had to search for the waitress to ask for more water, and the coffee we ordered with dessert, wasn't served util after we had finished our dessert. coincidentally, the gm visited our table as we were finishing our dessert, and apologized for the service, by comping our dessertcoffee. that's nice, but i'm not looking to receive anything for free. i want a great dining experience. this was a special lunch celebration and everyone was very disappointed.

the apartment complex is actually just student accommodation except most of the students had moved out. this was not a huge deal breaker for us as we are students but there were other families and guests just as shocked as we were and some requested refunds and moved out because this was not clear. when booking it is advertised that you have access to the roof terrace however, you actually are not given this access and are not allowed up there whereas the student tenants already living there appear to be. i booked 3 rooms all in one go in one transaction and yet none of the rooms were in the same flat- with one being on a different floor entirely. this was a massive inconvenience. the bathroom was lovely, you felt safe and secure and the staff were lovely and helpful. stayed in june 2021|2.0|2021-06-13 01:00:00
"although the menu is somewhat limited everything we've had on our few visits (as locals to the area) has been very delicious. dessert seems to be more of a dinner menu item than lunch as on our visits at lunch time there seems to be few to no options.
the service is optimal and we especially commend ramona for both optimal service along with connecting on a personal level with her customers. she's a true professional.
the ambiance is wonderful. there are several dining spaces that each have their own unique qualities. one offering the view of beautiful sunsets over the hudson river. the other enveloping you in a dark more intimate warmth or in summer being able to enjoy the beautiful courtyard gardens while dining alfresco. there's also a private dining room and a small and friendly bar area."|5.0|2021-11-21 13:03:00

the only two things that could be an issue is that the location of where you have to pick up the key is at the other side of town! also if you have loud neighbours you may hear them a lot. the location is great as it is on grafton street. the apartment has everything you need and is clean and tidy !. the cooking area and utensils were great. i had an issue with working the stove but i rang customer help line and they were amazing! stayed in march 2021|3.5|2021-04-01 01:00:00

food was incredibly mediocre and overpriced. i had the sea bass ceviche, corn and birrias. the sea bass was the best out of the three but it was solidly ok and nothing to write home about. the birria were the same quality of something you might get served at a hotel bar. ambiance and service was excellent but food was low quality in comparison to price. would have been better off going to any of the other places on sawtelle.|1.0|2021-10-04 18:22:00

the hostess initially seated us right by the kitchen door, but upon request moved us to a nice table next to the fireplace. our server was attentive and did a great job. we got the salmon which was excellent. the bathrooms are currently under renovations so you had to go to the hotel and it was a bit of a hop skip and a jump to get there.|4.0|2021-05-15 15:37:00

went there for the christmas holidays. was extremely disappointed that there were zero holiday decorations in the entire dining area. our reservations were for three people. the restaurant was completely booked the entire day except 3:30. we took that time. unfortunately, one member could not get there in time. the hostess didn't even ask if we would be happy with a 2 seat table. the stuck us in the corner behind a wall pillar. we were the only people in this room the entire time. while it was nice to have the room to ourselves, we were somewhat insulted. i thought they were booked solid?? our appetizers just hit the table and behind that server was the server with our main course. was not very enjoyable at all|3.0|2021-12-06 04:37:00

there was a half eaten pizza on the floor in the hallway, right next to the door to our room. there were similar outside other rooms in the hall also. quite a bit of noise and activity on our floor also, which wasn't ideal - we had to get up at 5am for a flight. (i wondered if the hotel was also being used for homeless accommodation - which is fine, would have been nice to know prior to booking.) also, i requested a five am wake up call when i checked in. i did not receive a wake up call. hotel is nice. room was great. staff were lovely and communicative. stayed in december 2020|2.5|2021-01-03 00:00:00
this was a lovely find. great indooroutdoor dining options. seared tuna was fantastic, lobster roll was stellar and my son even ate his steak brochette! the pinot noir from willamette valley was a welcome surprise on the menu. place was bustling so be prepared to wait a little even if you have reservations, but the staff is so nice you won't feel inconvenienced. overall a great experience.|4.0|2021-08-28 18:21:00

absolutely no effort made to offer a decent selection of vegan or even vegetarian options; only two main courses on the menu, one of which wasn't available on the night so i had to order two starters. we dined at 7.30pm on a saturday evening, so hardly difficult to predict and make available sufficient options. the food was mediocre at best and i think their reputation is built solely on sunday roasts. fine if you want average pub grub but vegansvegetarians clearly not welcome here!|2.0|2022-02-22 10:16:00

we wanted to do something different for new year's eve. we pulled up open table and seating was available. we took a chance, and actually arrived a little early for a reservation. seating was plentiful, and we were seated near the bar. the menu was quite small. i ordered the pork chop entree with risotto and a side caesar salad. my pork chop and risotto was perfect! the side caesar salad looked like a premade bag salad. dressing was served on the side, which was fine. my husband ordered the chicken entree. his chicken was dried out completely! it looked dry setting on his plate. the chicken was bone in, so may have been difficult to measure doneness. he ordered the creamed spinach and the side caesar as well. the caesar for him didn't arrive until his entree was served. the creamed spinach looked like a ramekin of soup. overall, the experience was less than satisfactory. the wait staff were attentive and sweet, so the problem lies in the kitchen. we are not likely to return. we used the valet parking, which was $12 plus tip. we had hoped that they may offer validation at the restaurant for customers coming in for dinner only. that was not the case.|3.0|2022-01-03 23:52:00

i was pleasantly surprised with my lunch experience at cara. the hotel has an infamous past as the coral sands motel. the space is transformed into a beautiful boutique hotel that feels luxe and special. everything that me and my party ordered was tasty with a rich flavor profile which matched well with the sexy vibe of the hotel. we ordered the lemon pasta, ceviche, beet salad, side of chicken, non-alcoholic beverages and two dessert. all dishes were memorable that satisfied all of our refined palettes. this foodie recommends this dining option.|5.0|2021-11-25 12:14:00

"after a recent knee surgery, my husband assisted me to the restroom during our dinner. we got back to a cleared table. umm do they still offer server training 101? it was an embarrassing moment for sure. that level of embarrassment was topped by the waiter chasing us down with the check at the front desk as i was trying to explain to her what the restaurant had done.
not sure if they are used to the millennial dine and dash, but we were hotel guest with a credit card on file.
i thought this should have been addressed by upper management. i still haven't heard back from anyone."|3.0|2021-03-28 23:40:00

the breakfast was excellent. the bed and bed coverings were very comfortable. there was a sign on the entrance stating that masks were to be worn in all public areas of the hotel. this did not happen at all. most of the staff and the visitors wore no mask. the toilet in our room 208 did not flush properly. it certainly needs to be attended to at once. it was impossible to close the windows as they were too high and at 80+ jumping on to a chair would have been hazardous.|2.5|2021-10-27 02:00:00
"we booked this pub as it had been recommended to us. sadly it failed to live up to expectations.
soggy chips (these were replaced but were still soggy so i gave up and didn't eat them). three of us had the steak but they were all tough and sinewy. the chef had put lumps of bacon in the blue cheese sauce and the mushroom sauce was bland. we mentioned all this to our waitress, who i will say was fantastic, and she said she would pass on our comments. we expected a manager to come over and apologise but no one did.
it was only when we went to pay and noted there was no reduction that we queried why no one had apologised or explained the issues. the manager then came over to say the chef was new and that there were communication problems as english was not his first language and that there had been other complaints about the food. i was embarrassed that we had to ask for a reduction on the bill and feel this should have been offered."|4.0|2021-09-26 16:26:00
room was a great size and the tv had all the relevant channels you may need when on a break away! the restaurant in the hotel, china sea, was delicious and staff were friendly and nice! the bar in the hotel was a lovely spot to have a few drinks while enjoying company or while watching football, the staff were amazing too as they went above and beyond with their service. nothing - loved it here!|5.0|2022-03-20 01:00:00

"evening dinning on the patio is very dark and it's hard to your food. there are no lights on the tables and just overhead decorative lights. additionally, the serving plates are dark gray which further complicates visually seeing your food.
we had a small flashlight that we used to walk from our room to the restaurant and we used it to read the menu and see our plates. the couple behind us used their cell phones.
when we commented on it to our food server he apologized said that he would talk to management. when we brought our bill, he had to use his cell phone to light it for us to see it. our server had adjusted our bill giving us his employee discount ($12) which was a nice, but it was not his issue. we tipped his discount plus as appreciation for his effort.
based our experience i would not recommend evening patio dinning if you want to see what you're eating. as for the food quality, my husband did enjoy the flat steak dinner (held the flash light so he could see it to cut the meat). my tortilla soup was lukewarm, the breakfast was average and at happy hour i had a shrimp quesadilla that was very bland and disappointing. i will say the burger i had was good and their cocktails were good."|2.0|2021-10-30 00:22:00

bedroom was on the first floor, with master bedroom overlooking the main street. the property was spacious, with all amenities (towels, toiletries, etc.) provided for. the kitchen was fully furnished, and we quite enjoyed the cosy living room. master bedroom windows were double glazed, thus noise was less of an issue. we noted however, that the master bedroom could be a bit warm, as central heating timing was set both by the hotel and by the guests themselves. this was easily remedied by keeping the windows slightly open for a few hours. there were some hours that central heating was turned on even though we turned it off from our end. the smaller room overlooked the central courtyard, and was noisy for the last night as someone may have had a celebration downstairs. the living room was by far the room that had the most noise from many vehicles passing by the main street.|5.0|2021-01-01 01:00:00

"such a disappointment! our waitress was rude when we asked if we could substitute toast for a biscuit on one breakfast, simply saying ""we don't do that"" rather than offering to go ask the cook.
then when our food arrived, it was lukewarm at best, and both orders were wrong (scrambled eggs for one breakfast rather than eggs over medium, and soggy bacon rather than crispy bacon on the other breakfast as requested). plus, the scrambled eggs were so overdone, they were brown, and i couldn't eat them. yuck.
don't think we'll be going back after all that."|2.0|2021-10-04 06:23:00
"food was good. green salad was just the greens, no tomatoes, or anything else. deemed a bit odd. tomahawk short rib was very flavorful. it is a fatty cut so if sharing, get sides or appetizers. desserts were good but not great.

food was great, staff were nice, helpfull and friendly, beds were lovely and comfortable. hotel in a great location too being on the mainstreet. at 307 for 2 nights for one person i thought it a little steep, but it was a late booking i suppose. room was comfortable but being able to hear people almost whispering in the next room.was annoying, there must be no soundproofing between rooms. the hotel phone on my locker rang a few times throughout the night aswell. all the doors seem to bang when they close which is annoying at 1, 2 , and 3 o'clock in the morning when you have people going from one room to another, although i think i heard management at 2:30am telling people to keep the noise down which im sure happens in most hotels.|3.5|2021-08-15 02:00:00

we have rediscovered this restaurant so have been here several times in the last 3 months. food is consistently very good and service is always great. last night food took about an hour to come out of the kitchen. we heard from our server they were very busy and that is wonderful for the establishment. i realize all restaurants are having challenges with securing employees. we were having dinner with friends we haven't seen for a while so there was a lot of catching up so the wait wasn't too inconvenient. i just knew our guests were hungry and probably didn't expect an hour wait for their dinner. everyone enjoyed their food .|3.0|2021-06-13 20:02:00

amazing quaint pub in lovely village surroundings. they have created a lovely and safe outside space to eat. my daughter had the pizza with freshly baked dough on the pizza hut and the steak and ale pie i had was delicious. the starters were above average sizes so we were pretty full. above all the service and atmosphere was fab. a group of morris dancers serenade us with their music, shame we missed the dancing. highly recommended! well done national trust!|4.0|2021-09-27 16:42:00
the meals overall were ok. we've been coming for 8 years and always preferred the beaver for its nice mix of meals..nice reasonably priced pub type food and some fancier specials if wanted, but felt it had gone a little over priced and the menu wasn't as mixed, aired more on the fancy side. one main was 20 and had to be sent back.. still a good place to go and eat but prefer how it used to be.|3.0|2021-10-24 11:14:00

"visited on the advice of friends who live on the area - we were not disappointed, lovely, traditional looking country building of stone. inside also traditional but with a slick, clean and airy feel to it. very nice.
the food was of a standard in which you'd expect of a michelin rosette establishment. very elegant food that displays the kitchen's prowess with the knife and deep knowledge of flavours and their respective combinations. really the was considered and superb.
the service was excellent, attentive and warm without being overbearing - just right. bravo.
in short i would highly recommend the candlelight inn to anyone wanting a meal on the nicer end of the spectrum."|5.0|2022-01-02 05:40:00

on the day off check in we thought we weren't going to make it because of the weather and the hotel were willing to change the date of our stay at such short notice, the receptionist sinead couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. we ended up making it that day and we were really surprised to find a lovely welcoming plate of goodies in or room to wish us a lovely wedding anniversary. the staff were all so friendly. the room was huge and had everything we needed. the food for dinner and breakfast was excellent. also one of the most reasonably priced hotels around & i would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely go back some day. i'm not really complaining because our stay was fantastic but if i had to list a few genuine and small negatives: the bed was a little firmer then i like. there seemed to be a fairly constant noise just outside the room like a refrigerator running. there were a few noisy guests talking loudly and late into the night but that's not the hotels fault.|4.5|2022-02-21 01:00:00

"excellent food and service. would have given 5 stars, but for the fact that vegetarian options are somewhat lacking on the menu.
my girlfriend (who is veggie) and i came for sunday roast. i had the pork which was absolutely delicious, and one of the best pub roasts i've had. the veggie roast (wellington) had unfortunately run out by the time we arrived, but the staff arranged to serve another main (aubergine) with roast trimmings, which was appreciated and enjoyed.
however, my partner noted that there were only two other veggie mains on the menu (the aubergine and a vegetable curry), both of which only contained vegetables and were not based around any sort of protein source. a cursory glance at the regular dining menu reveals a similar picture.
if anyone from the red lion is reading this, please consider adding a dish or two based on e.g. tofu, tempeh, seiten, lentils, chicpeas, edamame, halloumi, eggs. it's not difficult, but hungry veggies need their proteins too!"|4.0|2021-10-13 06:12:00

outdoor dining in back felt like a garden, dani was an attentive and personable server. the chicken and waffles along with our fish and chips were wonderful. interesting, creative cocktails. prices were of great value. recommended it this place to some at our hotel. walking distance to fremont street experience, which we did after dinner. a thorough delight!"|5.0|2021-10-21 07:32:00
"i received a call from the restaurant to inform me the rooftop was closing to prepare for the rain. i was told dinner would still be hosted but inside. i agreed to keep the reservation, not knowing the inside was actually in the downstairs lobby of the hotel. the service was basic: take our order, one check in, bring the check. our party was just not feeling it so we decided to leave sooner rather than later.
i understand the restaurant's desire to be accommodating but i wish they would've been more 1. forthcoming with the information and 2. delivered better service. i still like the rooftop but it's honestly not high on my list."|2.0|2021-12-14 21:31:00
way too expensive. food was good, but it took over an hour and it was $150 for nachos, a cheesesteak, a burger, and a few drinks. from a food truck. we stayed at the hotel, it was an hour and a half drive and definitely wasn't worth it. they also brought us other peoples' food 2 times and there was only 1 waitress for like 40 tables. i felt so bad for her, she was losing her voice. it def wasn't her fault. this place is run poorly.|1.0|2021-09-19 11:13:00

"it's not often that i dine twice at a restaurant on a short 5-day trip. but here's my confession i'm an il corso returnee. it happened like this.. after dining the previous night at 4 saints (an experience i would like to forget) and after fleeing a scary ""mediterranean"" restaurant just a half hour earlier, we landed at our table at il corso. (the crazy thing it that is was right next door to our hotel. why, oh why, didn't i go there in the first place? live and learn..) anyway, i enjoyed the vibe and i loved the room. it all felt good. believe me when i say it got even better when the food arrived. high-level cooking in every dish. for instance, i've eaten a lot of calamari in my day (a lot!) and i was astounded to taste the best calamari of my life at il corso. it didn't matter what dish we ordered, the quality remained top notch. and, listen, the service was not about to be outdone by the cooking. marvellous attention to detail and to our wishes. we shared everything and il corso split every plate for us, they even split the glasses of wine we ordered! after leaving on a cloud, i cancelled a reservation at another restaurant and returned to il corso two nights later to an experience just as marvellous. i'm going to dine here every time i'm in ps. you should, too."|5.0|2022-04-20 01:44:00

the hotel and the room is clean. the location is very good, walking distance to stephen's green and bus stop is just right in front of the hotel, including the one from the airport (700), which makes the journey from the airport very convenient. there are bara and reataurants nearby if you dont want to walk to city centre or eat in the hotel. breakfast is quite pricey for the variety of food you are getting (no pancakes, not many cold cuts and fruit selection). toiletries provided in the room is limited to one hand wash bottle and a bodyhair shampoo. for a 4-star hotel i would expect more standard items (e.g. conditioner, body lotion, shower cap) without having to ask the reception, especially if you stay for only 1-2 nights and dont want to bring those extra items. the price per night at the weekend we were staying was super expensive (i understand there are conferences going on in dublun), which probably would not be a matter if you experience a real 4-star hotel experience.|4.0|2022-05-09 02:00:00

our visit consisted of ordering the cocktail 'bailamos' 2 glasses of the rose, and 3 glasses of paco & lola white blend. we also ordered the meat and cheese plates as well as the patatas bravas."|4.0|2021-06-27 23:34:00

staff at breakfast and in bar were friendly nothing else could be said positive. this was the stuff of nightmares. the room allocated to us was infested with clothes moths which were crawling on the floors and also covering the ceiling. we only really noticied how bad this was on the second night (as we were not in the room much the first night and start of 2nd day). as a result of this horrendous experience when visiting relations after our stay one of these flew out from a bag we were carrying nearly infecting their house as well. we told reception on departure about our experience and for our trouble they gave us our breakfasts for free and told us that they would say it to the cleaning staff. nobody should have to pay for this filthy health hazard especially not 470. i explained that they need to get this room decontaminated before this infestation spreads to the rest of the hotel (ie professionals need to be brought in). this hotel should be quarantined by the hsa hotel authority and guests prevented from staying until this issue is resolved. we have to now inspect every item of clothing bag before washing each to avoid contaminating our house. other issues. on arriving the male receptionist who allocated this room was unfriendly and looked like he hated his job no room service available after 10pm (when we arrived the first night) bad smell in room breakfast cerial came in packets only this is an excellent area in dublin, i don't understand why this hotel is so bad.|0.5|2022-06-12 02:00:00

i had a wonderful stay at the royal marine. the room with sea view was lovely and comfortable. staff were very friendly. breakfast was well done in the ballroom to ensure distancing. buffet but only staff were allowed to dish up. bookings for pool so it was never really busy. spa staff are super friendly and olja is a great therapist. had a great stay, thanks again the common areas were a bit busy in the evening which was fine in the front sitting room and bar. but guests should probably not be allowed to drink in hallways as they are unmasked and you have to walk past them.|5.0|2021-07-03 02:00:00

"we had an amazing experience!
we did a date night to celebrate my bfs birthday and it felt very special.
i was worried about it being right off the hotel lobby, but once your seated the table is set beautifully, the staff are the perfect level of attentive, and the food was great!
would definitely recommend if you're trying to make a weeknight feel special."|4.0|2021-09-08 11:17:00
"dinner and service were very good.
only issue is parking. disappointed that we always have to park in the back requiring us to walk through smoking casino to get to restaurant. attendant should provide a ticket for restaurant reservations to put in window to park in reserved parking in front of building or allocated spaces that hotel parking now has. yesterday had to walk through smoking casino with small children as it was raining outside."|4.0|2022-01-17 03:11:00

we were very pleased with the location of the hotel and how central it was. the lobby and barrestaurant were fantastic and really surprised us. for the most part, the staff were very helpful and friendly. our room was fairly comfortable, and i and my partner loved the over-head shower, the water pressure was incredible. i also really like the defogger for the mirror. we got extra pillows like we asked for, which was lovely. the man that checked us in was quite brief and rushed the info. we aren't frequent travellers, and it would have been nice to be told about the keycard slot to turn on the electricity in the room. the bed wasn't a true double, it was two single mattresses pushed together, which left an uncomfortable groove in the middle of the bed. heating was on full blast for the whole stay.|4.5|2022-04-26 02:00:00

one of the best experiences we've had at a restaurant due to the professionalism and care of our waitress, ally. not only was she knowledge and fast, but she was great with our 3.5 year old son. ally's patience and experience working with children shined. after spending a long day at the park it was so helpful to have ally assist us at dinner time. thank you, ally, for also finding my phone! you helped these tired parents and we really appreciate you!|5.0|2022-02-20 15:01:00

location is perfect for us, a really good irish breakfast in a wonderful, nice and bright room. the staff is very supportive and helped me a lot with some personal problems. we were in a nice bedroom with a marvelous view and a really comfy bed. the only negative point is that the window goes to a balcony where some guests went at 6 am to chat and smoke, the fan from the bathroom is noisy too but nothing that important. will definitely be back. guest talking and smoking beside the bedroom window at 6:00 am .|4.0|2021-07-19 02:00:00

overall staff were very welcoming and helpful. hotel is right besideoverlooking beach and we were lucky to get good weather so absolutely made the most of that. the food was good, although the menu is a bit limited, particularly for lunch, but would recommend checking out the 'toastie van' on the terrace if it's open when you stay there. room was a bit dusty. no crispssnacks available to buy from bar which is surprising in general but particularly when hotel is more than 30 min walk from nearest shop, but overall a nice place for a short break.|3.5|2022-03-19 01:00:00

"i absolutely love the comus inn. it's one of my favorite places to be on a sunday morning. i have some concerns about the servers and hosts in particular. several times i have requested a booth on the second level in advance and when i arrive i'm told i'm unable to be seated where requested without much of an explanation.
many times there's a lot of confusion with regards to the menu. the servers and hosts could use a bit more training in customer service. the quality of service really doesn't match the overall classy aesthetic and amazing quality of food. i really think it's the only thing that needs improvement. but overall love love love this place!"|5.0|2021-10-11 11:53:00

arrived to a warm welcome from the staff, and clearly explained covid policies. there's a one way system around the hotel that made it seem nice and safe. the room was a nice size, with a beautiful view of the fjord and a well appointed bathroom. the bar and restaurant were both excellent. we both enjoyed a superb plate of mussels followed by a beautiful piece of monkfish. there were only a couple of things that i felt let the stay down slightly. firstly, the mattress, while comfortable enough for a good night's sleep, felt like the springs' best days were far behind them. that being said, we both slept like a log, so a minor quibble. my only real disappointment was with the cooked breakfast, which just wasn't up to the standard of the other food we had eaten the night before. the meats were lukewarm, as if they'd been sitting under lights for a while, and i hadn't been asked how i wanted the eggs, so i was given a fried egg by default. go for the smoked salmon and eggs instead.|3.5|2021-06-28 02:00:00

the chicken pot pie was very good as well as the risotto. it was a quiet weeknight. the overall service was ok. pleasant but had to ask for the soup and salad to be served prior to the entree, which seemed very odd at a restaurant such as this. the ice tea appeared to be instant, or at least there were grains on the bottom of the glass, more than just a little. my wife said the butternut squash soup was very good and my salad was fine. we live in st. charles so the chances of us coming back are slim with all of the other options that are available in that area. if you're in clayton and in the mood for chicken pot pie, go for it.|3.0|2021-12-31 15:23:00
i rarely leave poor reviews but our experience was so bad i feel the need to warn others about this place. the restaurant is located behind the eden roc hotel overlooking the ocean which is why i chose it because of its ocean side location but the restaurant is surrounded by a plastic tent covering which cuts off the ocean breeze and kind of defeats the open aired outdoor dining experience. when we arrived the hostess was extremely unorganized and rude. we waited for several minutes while she seemed preoccupied, then walked back and forth a few times saying she was checking on our table before she finally came back to get us. she lead us to a table in the middle of the dining room clustered around a lot of other tables. when we expressed we weren't comfortable sitting in close proximity to other diners in a tent environment w no open air she seemed annoyed but allowed us to choose a table further removed along the ocean side. a few minutes after we sat down the manager came over w a disgustingly dirty mask barely covering his chin w his nose and mouth completely exposed and muttered some long winded talk about why our tables service would be slow and why we should have sat in the other clustered section the hostess wanted to seat us in. then our waiter appears at the table wearing no mask at all to take our order. we kindly ask if he can put on a mask and he proceeds to talk at us acting annoyed that we asked about the mask. he returns a few minutes later wearing a mask to take our order. we order 2 pizzas off the very limited menu. only one arrives on time. our second pizza arrives 20 min later.. neither pizza had much flavor and definitely not worth the $30 they are charging. the booths have food stains all over them and the whole place just seemed dirty and poorly managed. there are no covid guidelines in place and the staff is rude when you suggest measures such as mask wearing and social distancing from other tables. save your time and $ and do not go here.|1.0|2021-12-22 00:16:00
very comfortable room with a great bed. the breakfast was very good - plenty of choice and served in a well spaced out breakfast room. also, the hotel has a tremendous bar area that serves proper cocktails. covid measures were implemented consistently throughout and the staff were helpful and efficient at all times. in fact, they were a pleasure to deal with. no complaints. the only (slight) negative is that the hotel car park is a bit of a distance from the hotel, which wasn't ideal on a rainy weekend. but, hey, the parking was free and secure, so it really is no biggie.|4.5|2021-11-02 01:00:00

i took my wife to the jw for a baby moon as i officiate college football and this was my last free weekend with her before our baby is due at the end of the year. while the hotel is excellent, this restaurant left a lot to be desired. i know the restaurant just opened but this was no way to make a first impression. we ordered the eggs breakfast, two cappuccinos, and their specialty donut. the donut was dried out. we sent that back immediately. the cappuccino arrived after 15 mins and they were cold. those were sent back and remade. the breakfast came out and the eggs had no flavor. they toast their bread on the grill so it tasted like the last piece of meat that was on the grill. my wife ordered the chicken sausage and it was a complete failure. the restaurant was heavily staffed and it was fairly empty. for this reason, i'm confused as to why we had so many issues. i also noticed a whole foods back sitting on the kitchen window. i would not recommend this restaurant for brunch.|2.0|2021-08-23 11:41:00

"we were a little disappointed that they missed my reservation comment that it was my son's birthday. i even reminded the hostess before we sat down. after dinner, i was confused when the waiter brought the bill and there had been no cake or singing of happy birthday. when i asked him about it, he asked if we brought a cake. i said no. and he then said, what do you want us to do, sing to him? i can give him a cupcake. i said sure, whatever you can do. he then saw the bag from the birthday package and asked if i had the card for the cake in the bag. the check-in receptionist just gave me the bag with no mention of what was inside. in the end, the staff came out with a cake and sang to him. but we felt embarrassed. there were some communication problems if my request wasn't seen by at least two people and i wasn't told about the card to give them. my son felt forgotten and unimportant. the waiter was otherwise pleasant though.
also, we had a 5pm reservation, but we were running late. i called before our reservation to let them know we were running about 20 minutes late. the girl i talked to said our reservation would be canceled after 15 min, but we could try walking in even though they were fully booked. fair enough if that's the policy, but she was on the border of being rude as she told me this. we almost didn't go, but then decided to try it. we were seated after just a short wait, so it wasn't too bad. but the girl on the phone could use some additional training on how to speak with customers."|4.0|2021-12-30 03:04:00

it would be nice to have clearly labeled veganallergy friendly items and less meat. the entire restaurant smelled like bacon and grease. staff was amazing but i don't like to have to speak to the chef. my anxiety won't allow it. please just make some plant based pancakes, have vegan butter and plant based coffee creamer. we appreciate the fruit and hash browns but they're so much more a chef could create.|3.0|2022-01-30 20:34:00
"check-in and breakfasts. first night, we were woken by someone banging about, slowly it quietened down - someone leaving early i thought. looked at the time 3am. no it was someone coming in! then through the paper thin walls we were kept awake by our neighbours coughing all night. next night woken up by ""the lads"" coming in at 2am, quietened down. then ""the girls"" came in at 3:30. then the snorers started next door. so in 2 nights, not a full nights sleep"|0.5|2022-04-01 02:00:00
the room could have been a little bigger, as it was a little difficult to move around inside it and to open the bags. i stayed in a double room, but the room is too small for two people, especially the bed. there was a lot of noise because of the pub next door, which made it difficult for us to rest. as much as the windows are soundproof, we feel heat at night, so we had to open the windows, and so the issue of noise became more complicated. it could have a minibar to store food, especially since the hotel's restaurant is closed on the day we stayed there. the decor is amazing, everything is very clean and comfortable. the employees were super polite and helpful. we were happy that there was a coffee and tea table next to our room. stayed in june 2021|4.5|2021-06-11 01:00:00

my wife & i were in town to visit our son at sacred heart university, and staying overnight. looking for a place to dine we looked to go to a restaurant nearby the hotel but seating was over an hour wait. we looked online and found this gem, booked a reservation for two - and so glad we did. i had the ny strip with a side of garlic mashed, my wife had a filet and the brussels sprouts with bacon. the steak and filet were done to perfection with a nice crust and juicy medium inside. the mashed was delicious with little pieces of garlic making homemade like and tasty. the staff was awesome, friendly and very helpful and the environment was more than just friendly. we're saving this for another visit with the rest of our family and can not wait to dine there again.|5.0|2021-10-27 05:11:00

very long wait to get our food out on a quiet sunday afternoon. burgers were very over cooked (well-cooked instead of medium-rare). they forgot one of our sides, and we had to tell our server to remove it from our bill. overall, a mediocre experience, though the views and ambiance were nice enough.|2.0|2021-12-14 02:40:00

the mill is starring to look old and dated. the paint is peeling, the chairs are old and broken and the tables are chipping. food is good bit the menu is exactly the same as it has been for years. they need a revamp of the decor and some new menu specials to keep the venue fresh and exciting otherwise they'll fall behind newer more modern places to dine|3.0|2021-10-19 23:57:00
"great choice on the menu, and food was beautifully prepared so that it looked fabulous. every dish was to the same high standard and delicious. front of house staff were obviously well trained and could explain what was on the menu and provided just the right level of attention.

being on a business trip, i usually look for a hotel close to the airport, close to the business venue, and with a touch of local culture - with being so close to swords, it was an ideal opportunity to take a 15min walk from the hotel. the room was great: clean, spacious, with coffeetea, a good size bathroom, clean towels, and hot water! the smokingbones restaurant next door was really nice - good atmosphere, great breakfast - loved the porridge! nothing to mention here!|5.0|2022-05-21 02:00:00
service was extremely slow unfortunately. it was approximately ah hour from when we sat down to when we got our food and had to ask for water for the table at that time. unfortunate as i've stayed in the hotel before and gotten great service in ryleighs. my friend asked if a rum cocktail could be made for her as she didn't want one off the brunch cocktail menu and was told that wasn't possible. it would be great to have the full cocktail menu at lunch time too because the cocktails on the dinner menu are amazing! just an off day i'm assuming|3.0|2021-08-20 12:14:00

"i went with may partner on 07112021 afternoon slot 2:30 pm pod 7, food was good, but the service was pathetic and below expectation, i think its a high time that the management should into consideration in how there staff should conduct the guests, i and my partner went to celebrate our birthday and was promised initially that we were been given with a birthday cake by the restaurant hence we didn't bring our own cake, later the staff told that we need to pay extra for the cake which was even fine because we don't have any choice. surprisingly there was no birthday cake available in the restaurant when we reached, which i had repeatedly told 2 days before the booking and asked if that is something possible from the restaurant end, if i would have told before i could have brought my own cake hence and we end up taking a small slice of cake for the celebration, this was real pathetic service.
moreover the staff were so cold and they don't even know how to shut the doors, we booked pod 7 and the staff every time were banging the doors loudly looks like they are extremely inexperience staff in hotel management and handling guests"|1.0|2021-11-10 03:50:00

tips are price-fixed at 19% regardless of party size (it was just me and my wife). from my experience, this practice leads to sub-par or just basic service. this was the case for our visit. at the seating, both seats were dirty (one was stained; one had crumbs), water was not refilled when low, another glass of wine was not offered (i had to ask), the view was spectacular (setting gulf sun) the good was just ok. the crab rangoon came out 60 seconds after we ordered it (so it seemed). they were cold inside. overall, convenient for us as we were staying at the grand wyndam and great location (view) but otherwise, nothing special about this place|3.0|2021-03-09 18:51:00
great views and setting. service started out strong and then fizzled. food served without utensils and took a long time to get them. steaks over cooked. they seemed to be understaffed. we were already done and the server said that we had reached our time limit. great and unnecessary way to kill any extra tip, as we were finished. gratuity is automatically added.|3.0|2021-03-08 15:00:00

we had a reservation for 6, got seated at 6:10, no big deal. we sat in a booth for 20 minutes before a waiter acknowledged us, which was 10 minutes after a separate waitress asked if had a server yet. we ordered 2 burgers and 2 spinach artichoke dips with 2 sodas and 2 waters. the food came out fairly quickly but the the artichoke dip was room tempcold. we had to flag down another server because we didn't see our server for some time. they brought us 2 new dips fairly quick. again, they were cold. we were baffled and when we let the server know they said, no the got you new ones. when i say cold, it was probably 75, which is pretty unappetizing. we were never offered refills and when we asked a passing server they said they'd find our server but he never showed up. it was the worst dining experience i've ever had and i hope this is review helps highlight some room for improvement.|1.0|2021-10-15 00:24:00

anniversary dinner at 6:00 pm on a friday after labor day at the ledges was wonderful! we had a the seafood special of 4 courses for $45.00 each. soup or salad (i chose: clam and oyster chowder, delicious!), mini raw bar (clams, oysters, scallops and lump crabmeat with a zippy cocktail sauce, so fresh!), salmon with smoked sugar glaze and a mousse for desert. we enjoyed ourselves immensely and what a view!!|4.0|2021-09-11 21:25:00
"four of us visited here for lunch on 4th dec. the xmas lunch menu was 16 for 2 courses all of which were beautifully presented and very tasty. great value for money.
all the young staff were constantly moving around checking customers tables and clearing when necessary and were very attentive throughout.
a chef to keep hold of no matter the cost and staff who are a credit to the townhouse.

the service was very attentive without being intrusive.
the hotel i am staying at has a discount with several restaurants, it is during a pandemic, so we had a slight discount that made it very nice.
the manager was very happy to help us, and suggested that we come back on wed for the wed special. i made another reservation last night.

the view from the rooftop of the new radisson blu hotel, blu skybar is incredible. you can see disneyland, disney's california adventure, the crystal cathedral, knott's, and on a clear day you can even see the l. a. skyline. the service is impeccable, and our server, kevin, is fabulous. drinks are delicious. food and drinks are very pricey, but you are paying for the view. the theme of the food is from northern spain, the basque region, and mostly seafood. if you don't have an adventurous or gourmet palate, you may not find plates to your liking. however, my friend and i ordered gambas, pan cristal and patatas fulano-de-tal, and we enjoyed them. since it was my friend's birthday, we were served complimetary churros with chocolate sauce. we'll definitely be back.|3.0|2021-05-07 23:01:00
"my friend and i were excited to try a new restaurant for dinner prior to a concert at the meyerhoff. we were pleasantly surprised by the decor and ambiance of the revival hotel. it presents an energetic and inviting location for the topside restaurant situated at the top of the hotel. at the top, the restaurant has great views of mt. vernon, the washington monument, and other cityscapes. we were greeted very nicely by the friendly hostess and our server and seated by a window with a beautiful view of the monument -- all decked out in its christmas lights. the menu looked intriguing but offered a few disappointments. the cocktail that i ordered was virtually tasteless (and it had the word ""fire"" in its name). the server offered to try get the bartender to make it right. even the correction was very watered down tasting. when we asked for bread while we waited for our entrees, we were told it came at a charge. ($5 for a 3""x4"" slice of foccacia or $14 for a bread basket. then our orders arrived, the food was very tasty. my friend noted how tender her ribeye was. it came with arugula tossed in vinaigrette. roasted brussel sprouts had to be ordered as a side. i ordered chilean sea bass, which was also tasty, but *tiny*. it looked like an appetizer. i kid you not. the serving of fish was the size of 2 (peeled) grapefruit sections. the two pieces were stacked on top of 14 cup of spinach, on top of a formed serving of rice (which was supposed to be a shrimp rice cake--but i couldn't detect a hint of shrimp). needless to say, i left there still as hungry as i came. i wish the venue well. it is a lovely spot and i would never discourage anyone from patronizing it, but beware of the chilean sea bass as an entree. it's not enough for a typical adult."|3.0|2021-12-06 03:00:00

the hotel is in a lovely situation near herbert park and within easy walking distance of ballsbridge. there is also a very handy row of local shops nearby. it was a large and comfortable room. the wifi was very effective. there was a microwave and fridge in the room which was very handy. it was up 3 flights of quite steep stairs and there's no lift, which we found difficult as we're not spring chickens. if we'd known we might not have booked. the sheet on the bed wasn't quite big enough and came loose in the night. the duvet wasn't big enough for the bed and resulted in 'duvet wars' between me and my wife. it was also very, very expensive for what it was.|4.0|2022-05-17 02:00:00
we went for a last minute sunday brunch while staying at a hotel downtown. found the place because it was the closest brunch to the hotel and seemed to have good reviews. we were blown away by the food and the friendliness of the staff and hosts. there were a few large private parties in the dining room so we sat at a high top by the door. like a lot of restaurants right now, they were a bit understaffed and that slowed things a bit, but we didn't mind at all. had a very nice conversation with the hostess and with igor, who recommended a very nice wine for us. i had the eggs benedict which were cooked to perfection and wife had the papardelle, which was outstanding. we both highly recommend it for the great food and the friendliness of the staff.|5.0|2021-11-15 17:31:00

"love the cedar plank salmon and coconut cake.
but today at 1:00 the service was poor. for example, when we got the delicious crunchy coconut shrimp appetizer, we had no plates to eat them. so we had to eat them without plates. we had to repeatedly ask for utensils and when our food arrived, we still hadn't received them. requested bread and it arrived when our meal was over and it was cold. it was our mom's birthday so very disappointed. they didn't even sing happy birthday.
the problem stems from having servers responsible for large parties also be responsible for serving smaller parties like ours. the large party took all of his attention so our little group of three suffered.
the smaller pool of workers these days may also play a role."|4.0|2021-11-14 17:25:00

conveniently situated the room was very cold as heating was not on and it was a freezing cold night. when i asked about the heating i was told it's on a timer and could not be adjusted so they brought up a heater. went to the bar for food and all i can say is never again!! this was our second time to eat in the bar ( was also baltic in here) and unfortunately the last time was every bit as bad. i said we would give it a second chance but i can honestly say never again. a simple caesar salad can't be that hard well obviously it is chicken like cardboard.. smothered with parmesan and i actually choked on something and iv no idea what it was the general manager was to ring me yesterday and i am still waiting.|2.5|2022-12-16 01:00:00

"table was sticky and dusty. only gave us 3 menus for 6 people. plastic silverware for kids. $11 uncrustables on the kids menu. weird, sad vibe overall.
we walked out before even ordering, so can't comment on the taste of the food, but decided the environment and off-putting service wasn't worth staying."|1.0|2021-10-06 01:22:00

at 4am in the morning we were awoken by a very very loud noise that continued for 30 mins. we called the front desk and they came up to our room to investigate. they found that the noise was coming from the hotel boiler. the noise was incredibly loud. they turned off the boiler. they must have turned it back on because an hour later it started again waking us up. we had to call the front desk again to address the noise. absolutely awful. our stay was ruined by this experience because we were unable to get decent rest before our travel home. i liked the cleanliness of the room we stayed in. stayed in december 2020|0.5|2021-01-23 00:00:00

cabanas themselves are great but the service is very slow. i don't think it is the fault of the wait staff, i think it is just a result of not having enough of them. and strangely, you aren't allowed to have lounge chairs outsides the lux cabanas to lay in the sun. we also stayed in this hotel 2 years ago and the cabanas were half the price they are now with less amenities. the worst part was management trying to severely upsell them. i booked on opentable but upon arrival, the staff tried convincing me the price was almost double what i booked them for. thankfully i spoke to the waitress who told me what the actual minimum spend was per day. i also inquired about getting the largest cabana but was told it was $2500 per day. i later found out it was only $950. overall, great location by the pool, they offer shade from the hot sun and the seats are guaranteed. other than that, i wouldn't recommend them for the cost.|2.0|2021-12-10 16:25:00

"we had our anniversary dinner there last night, monday, nov 15, 2021. wow! from the moment we walked up the stairs to enter, i kept telling myself ""this could never have been the old coral sands motel""..
what a remarkable, inviting and comfortable work of art in renovating this old worn down ""motel"" into a destination featuring dining in a setting where i think i may be in tuscany!
our server ""ruth"" was just perfect from attentiveness, knowledge, and mostly, ensuring we had a true dining experience. their wine list is extensive as well as their house cocktails, ruth was also knowledgeable about them, we started with evian water and a bottle of cab we had never tasted - great recommendation
my partner is gluten free ""gf"" and the menu certainly accommodated that in addition to an array of non gf items. the soup, burrata, salad, and the tasmanian steak..it did truly melt in my mouth. ruth advised us to keep some room for ""dessert"" - the butterscotch dessert was the bomb, and we had two others, all ending with an ""al fogato"" and a special ""happy anniversary"" topper on our desserts.
the main dining area is ""roofless"" and the evening was perfect. there was a gentle breeze, and the patio heaters, reflecting pool and other diners created a special vibe.
we have lived in los feliz, ca for over 25 years and cara is a very welcomed ""enhancement"" to our neighborhood - we are definitely coming back!"|5.0|2021-11-16 19:37:00

we arrived early and despite being a bank holiday weekend our room was ready by 2pm reception staff friendly. bar staff very good,. cost was 300 euro for one night and did not include breakfast. this did feel as if prices had deliberately been put up because of the bank holiday weekend. not to include the breakfast in the price did seem a stretch too far wrt price. the room was described as superior but we faced a brick wall and some of the furniture and pictures were a bit old and tired looking. bathroom was very good tho. the room was spacious.|3.5|2022-06-07 02:00:00

the hotel is lovely and the breakfast delicious. the location was great - 5 minutes lovely walk along the river to the city centre and we had a great view of the river. we were given a contract like piece of paper when we had dinner in the bar referring to a minimum spend per person and how long we could stay. there was no mention of this when i pre-booked the meal. i wouldn't have mined if i knew beforehand. the food was delicious but it put me off going back there to eat the second night.|4.5|2021-06-16 02:00:00
i booked a 2 night stay at the hotel here since i saw the winter wonderland hype on ig. the restaurant service was really unorganized. walked in as a line was starting to form. 4 workers including the supervisor were huddled at the hostess stand trying to figure out each individual issue together as we just starred at them waiting to be helped for 10 minutes. they really didnt seem to know what they were doing. i did have a reservation and waited for my food for over an hour. which didn't seem to make sense when the table next to us was seated 20 minutes after us and got their apps as we sat there waiting for mac and cheese, nachos, and chilli. it was clear the kitchen forgot about our table. the supervisor apologized and took off the nachos and gave us a free round of drinks. we were just disappointed overall. the ig hype was all it was hype.|3.0|2021-12-28 03:37:00

the location was great. staff were friendly. easy check in. my window did not shut fully, leaving the room really cold. also neither radiator in the bedroom or bathroom worked. coupled with an open window, left the room freezing. i barely slept the first night due to getting rained on and then being frozen in my room. i informed reception in the morning, who said someone would take a look in the day. i went out all day and returned at 20.30pm no one had been. the next receptionist had no idea what i was talking about, but told me the night man who comes on at 10pm will take a look. again, no one came. i slept fully clothed. i complained on check out the next morning. staff were apologetic, which was appreciated.. however not much help after my stay was complete. unfortunately i'd already paid in full prior to arrival. i don't mind there being issues, if when you report them, they are sorted. i was fobbed off with 3 different reasons as to why my heating didn't work and told twice it would be looked at. which never happened. to be honest it put a dampener on my trip as i was tired and drained and cold!|1.5|2022-02-11 01:00:00

"it wasn't clear where the entrancehost was so we walked through the dining area into the hotel and found it. i said hi and told the woman our name and said we were here for our 7 pm reservation. she was immediately defensive saying they have no tables available and we'd have to wait until they do in a very rude manner with no apology. i pointed out to her that not only did we have a reservation which i'd made 2 weeks prior but that there was a table that could be available if someone bussed it. she yelled ""do you see how busy we are""! we walked back to where our friends were waiting who had overheard the conversation and discussed leaving. then we saw this woman come out and start clearing the table so we waited. i'm glad we did because the food was delicious and the band was terrific. service was spotty but once we got over the rude hostess things went well. too bad that our overall mood was tainted by the first impression of one rude employee."|4.0|2021-10-27 17:50:00

way overpriced for the whole experience. outside of being next to the beach, no ambiance at all. wooden tables with laquer are sticky and should have table cloths. both meals the plates were covered with meltedburned butter and garlic. $55 lobster tail was overcooked. appetizers were nothing spectacular and the dessert that we returned was not good at all. even with $125 per person don't worry about dress code. flip flops, shorts and faded tee shirts are absolutely acceptable. like folks came from their room in the motel. i would not return. all average at best and definitely not worth the money. sorry chef mike|1.0|2021-09-23 10:59:00

from start to finish, 100% regret booking a room here. worst experience in 42 years of travel and 37 countries visited.. from the moment i arrived it was terrible. there was nobody to answer the door, i phoned a number of times until someone answered who then phoned the receptionist who came to the door without a face mask; asked me to prove to her that i had paid for the room, i then was given a room with a shared bathroom instead of the 'on suite' i booked (and paid extra for), the shared bathroom was very dirty, loose dirty soap bars, one dirty towel to share (no towels in the room). i asked for the receptionist name and was told that she was not there to give me her name only to give me the keys. it was filthy, the mattress was lumpy, there was no upper sheet and i know they don't wash the duvet cover after every use, the bottle of water left in the room was dirty and half full.. if you're still planning on booking this place make sure to carry one of those disposable tyvek suits, nothing stayed in december 2020|0.5|2021-01-04 06:00:00

pros: break down of delta f2f interview you are being interviewed by flight attendants and other hr recruitment will be in the back watching your every move. you arrive they split you into 3 groups each group is assigned a task. one group will do their f2f, the other group will have a q&a where if you're wanting the job ask as many questions as possible. during this section they will be doing a jump seat test where the belt is only about 18 in around (smaller than a regular airplane seatbelt) but there are bigger people as fa don't let that scare you. and a test to see if you can reach the the storage cabins on a boeing 737. the 3rd group will be doing a cart activity where you need to read the instructions in full, delegate who does what, work and talk as a team, they don't give you any feedback the entire time so you're just guessing, you're putting on the drinks, ice trays, snacks and lunches there even is a peanut allergy so watch that. (it's only a 10 minute exercise work fast) they give you no instructions other than to read the paper. (google what an airline cart looks like). after all task are completed they break you down into zones 1, 2, and 3 if your are escorted out in the first group you didn't get it, second group is a maybe, and there's group that stays you hit the job you will do your fingerprint and drug test in spot. they give you really good encouraging words but i'd rather have honesty they lie to your face saying wait for an email when they no you didn't get it. training is for 6 weeks and is it $7.25 where you work 50 hours a week. pay after training is $32.50 based on flight hours when the cabin doors close a $2.48 per diem if you are not home or moving and are still on company time. everybody is super fake friendly to the point where they'll compliment your whole outfit but they no you're not the right pick. currently as of november 2022 they only have an offering of the worse airports, you will only work domestic flights as a junior fa as they told us a lot of oklahoma, idaho, south dakota random places like that. so if you're doing it for the thrill and wanting to travel i recommend trying a different airline the senior fa get first grabs of flying abroad. if you live where there isn't any bases you will have to either commute which can lead you to paying for your own hotel if you are left somewhere or taking your days off to travel ahead of time to your base. or to move and there is no moving package it's all on you financially to move. i got all the way to the f2f on my first try and i won't be applying again as you have to wait 6 months. just move on to another airline that promises to have you home every night and have relocation packages. bigger airline name does not mean they are better. cons:would rather have a company tell me the honest truth rather to lie advice to management: be honest with people. this is for anybody wanting to be a flight attendant and get to the face 2 face interview in atl just giving out some pointers.|1.0|2022-11-27 13:32:00
food was top notch. dinner 2 evenings and breakfast each morning was really good. rooms were clean spacious and comfortable. leisure facilities and leisure staff were brilliant.. absolutely no problem with location being involved with hospitality many years myself, i felt the staff were very robotic. no conversation or talk with them but i guess that's the way they're trained. on one occasion a drink was forgotten on our order and when we followed it up, the staff member did apologise but then proceeded to to check with every staff member to make sure it was ordered and paid for which was quite embarrassing. this after paying 100 euro for our meal and 3 other rounds of drink. also we always pay on arrival. the fee charged on arrival was cheaper than expected but we thought, that's great and went on about our business. until our final morning whilst still asleep, reception called the room to inform us we had a balance on our rooms. we did pay the balance but we also felt that with no apology, plus the fact we were considering extending to another night( which totally put us off), plus the fact that i have always been trained that if you make a mistake that you stand by it, or at least split the difference. the staff simply need to be more outgoing and friendly with the customers although don't necessarily blame them as it could be coming from higher up the ladder and the staff maybe have to do as told. just not a great way to be. improve this and then there would be top marks all round.|3.0|2022-07-01 02:00:00

the service was very good, staff were friendly, polite and professional. bridget did everything she could to sort out our room, and we were given a discount on the room for the inconvenience caused. the food was good and the drawing room was a nice place to relax. the beds were comfortable. the hotel overall was pleasant but the twin room we were in was run-down and in need of an upgrade. our window wouldn't close, we only had one bedside lamp in a twin room and it was broken, the phone didn't work and the kettle was dirty inside. we asked to be moved to another room, and the receptionist was very helpful but it still took nearly an hour for us to be settled into a suitable room (we were first moved to an accessible room where it wasn't possible to stand under the shower) and we ended up cancelling our second night. the rooms felt very spartan, a revamp and a bit more care into small touches (e.g. there was only one pillow provided per bed in the first room) would greatly improve the hotel.|3.0|2021-07-30 02:00:00

the nash is a great venue for a family celebration. we often go for birthday brunches as the resto is spacious and the ambiance is beautiful. the last time we went was march 020, just before everything closed due to covid so we were happy to return as a family. we had great service, some very yummy cocktails (hotel nacionale) and good food. the cinnamon bun is always shared and was decimions as always. as it was lent we had a number of fish dishes which were good but could have been better. i'm always grateful for how accommodating everyone who works there is. on the way out the kids saw the rotisserie so i suspect that what's up next for us!|4.0|2022-03-14 20:42:00

lovely evening with great food. the lobster linguine was incredibly spicy for my wife and the pasta was not 'al dente' but when we brought this to the staff's attention, they promptly replaced it with an alternative, the mushroom risotto, which was delicious, and is a sign of great service. everything else was cooked to perfection with seasonal flavours and a fine touch. the ambience was cosy and the decor exquisite. highly recommend it for a date-night away from the kids (although i can see how the kids will also enjoy it at lunch). looking forward to going back soon.|4.0|2021-12-24 10:27:00
"it was our wedding anniversary and first trip to london with our 5 year old. i had pre booked some restaurants but not this one. it was a bit of a dummy run for a big weekend planned for the spring to see how our little one would cope with crowds,walking and a hectic schedule. all booked last minute so getting into restaurants was not easy.
we failed epically on most things that day!! by the time we got to covent garden she was tiredhungry and just about done! i booked on line 45 mins before we arrived for the only reservation i could get that afternoon for an outside table. our reservation was at 5pm. we arrived at 4.15 and the hostess was simply amazing! not only did she squeeze us in, but got us a lovely table inside with a plenty of room for madame to curl up in our coats whilst we had a fabulous meal to celebrate our anniversary!
the food was outstandingservice impeccable and the staff were so understanding! i took my main course home in a takeout bag and ate it at the hotel but that was so not their fault! it was to stop the monumental meltdown that was about to occur!
hands down one of my most enjoyable moments of the weekend! the ceviche and oysters were perfect!! xx"|5.0|2021-10-11 02:45:00

"visited with girlfriends for lunch yesterday 19th june for al fresco lunch.
having read some not so favourable reviews about the outside seating area i was somewhat apprehensive however, from the moment we arrived to the moment we left [and without being rushed off of our table] i cannot fault the experience in any way whatsoever.
if you are a little surprised to find yourself seated in an outside car park which has been 'done up' to accommodate outside dining regulations at the moment, then you are mistaken. the outside area, in normal circumstances, is in fact a small in out access to the rear of the hotel and ballroom entrance. there is plenty of cover overhead, blankets on your seats as you arrive and if you wish, a hot water bottle to keep the elements from settling-in but, not required by all of us yesterday.
the food was excellent, as was the presentation and arrival time for any of the food drink to get to the table. there was a variety of diners, socially distanced from us, all of which seemed to be enjoying an equally pleasant afternoon's dining.
the pandemic and the now recent opening-up has meant that the hospitality industry has had to rethink how it can maximise its offerings and if this temporarily equates to a bit of an alternative al fresco seating area as is currently at the biltmore then, in my book, this is well thought out and without any complaint from six ladies who enjoy fine dining - we are used to eating out at the more established of establishments [when we have been able to] so we know good food service levels.
therefore, please visit the biltmore, it was a lovey occasion, food drink reasonably priced and given its kitchen host, a certain mr atherton, you know before you get there that you will not be disappointed! will definitely visit again even if only for a quick cocktail in one of the rather swanky looking bars lounge areas.
thank you to the biltmore for a lovely afternoon yesterday!"|5.0|2021-06-20 06:32:00

terrible. prepare for waiting, which was ok because we weren't in a hurry. however, we ordered an appetizer which was brought 45 minutes later and our food arrived less than a minute later. our server never came to check. got no refills. even if our food took awhile, the server still could have gotten us drinks. and we were ordering alcohol and willing to spend money, it's not like we wanted him to keep refilling water. my food didn't come, the pasta divolo and when the waiter finally stopped by to check back after the food was delivered, he said that the dish wasn't available even though it's still on the menu. he said he could get me a menu and i could order a new dish. at this point it has been almost an hour so in no way do i want to wait another hour for a plate. he sure didn't mind including the 18% gratuity on the bill. probably the worst dining experience i've ever had. i would not recommend this place even to my worst enemy. it's convenient to the hotel and the patio is fairly nice, but good luck with the over priced food, that is if you're even lucky enough to get a plate.|1.0|2021-12-28 17:02:00

while in nashville, janice and i had the opportunity to host our great niece and her roommate for dinner. they are students at vanderbilt and we don't get to see them often, so we wanted to try something special for them. the marsh house at the thompson hotel certainly fit the occasion. we took an early (5:00 pm) reservation as it worked well for everyone's schedules. we spent a few minutes socializing before ordering and were not rushed along. the restaurant offers a happy hour oyster special for $1each, which made for an excellent starter. we also drinks and a very tasty ceviche before our main plates. everyone had something different from scallops to grouper to garlic shrimp to a crawfish pasta. all were enjoyed! our server, kaitlin, was super. she anticipated every need and made sure we were well taken care of. finished off with a variety of desserts and more conversation. a very pleasant, leisurely meal was had by all. we will certainly keep the marsh house on our list for our next visit to nashville.|5.0|2021-09-28 14:52:00
the location is amazing - the view of the lake as you come out through the castle is utterly beautiful, out of a fairy tale. the food in the lodge was good and staff very helpful and my room was very comfortable. some shortcomings may be due to the pandemic and a shortage of staff, but booking all meals and times in advance was a nuisance, there is no porter to take one's luggage from the car, nor space to park the car for a short period to move it into the hotel. these may well be different when the pandemic has abated. what i did not like and for which i could see no excuse was not being able to have a sandwich at lunchtime at the castle. i was first told it would be fine, but then the young lady had to tell me her manager told her they could not do sandwiches, only afternoon tea. i did not want a full afternoon tea, and left. this is not 5 star service. also, i booked the break on the basis of the walks around the estate but found a lot of them were closed off and those i could use were not very well signposted.|3.5|2021-07-24 02:00:00

when asked to accommodate for our party to be seated next to each other, the hostess said certain tables were reserved, but there were so many places our entire party could have sat together. we were also told we only had 1 hour and a half to stay once we sat. when we were sat down, the tables were still uncleaned and the hostess didn't bother cleaning it. she wasn't friendly & didn't say anything to let us know about the menu. it took a while to get our order down and when told we were ready to order, we still had to wait longer. while we were eating, i noticed our waiter walk passed the other table with the rest of my party, then just shake his head and laugh to himself?? the employees are obviously rude & uninviting. at least the view is okay|3.0|2021-07-08 20:17:00
the food was tasty but on the expensive end and unnecessarily large quantity. we ordered kids food first, which most restaurants bring out kids food quicker this way. not here. they waited until adults food were ready and brought them out. one kid food is cold, the other missing. at the end, all is good. but the waiting is excruciating when you have two hangry young kids.|3.0|2021-12-31 05:47:00

"dragon's den has so much unmet potential. it appears to be pretty cute upon first impression, but the food and service fail miserably. we ordered 5 different things from the menu, only 1 was decent. everything we ordered was extremely overpriced for the crap quality you receive. both times i've been to this restaurant we just leave upset overy the poor quality of food, ridiculous prices, slow service and still feel hungry for ""real"" food and wishing we had gone off campus or ordered in for good food. it just really stinks because we want so very much to love it. it's convenient. it's on the legoland property and has lego decor so our kids get so excited. but i just wish that this place (legoland as a whole) would just up their game. disneyland pays attention to every detail while legoland sadly falls short in every area. i don't know if it's because they don't want to spend the extra money or if they need a new manager. idk. but if they ever want to be as successful as disneyland (as they seem to aspire with their ever raising prices, they are going to need to step it up. we want this place to succeed and flourish. it can be so much better."|1.0|2022-02-09 15:18:00

breakfast good, i like whole fresh fruit and my partner enjoyed full irish and delish brown bread. we very much liked the no problem hot water for bath and shower in the morning. thank you. room was average. we were facing back of building i believe. there was no ventilation at night but the window was hard to open and would not stay up so we had to place a plastic bottle to keep it from closing. there were only two coffee sachets each so we asked for more. most importantly, there was an incessant background noise of a motor running at all times which was most audible all through the night. we would have liked a different room in hindsight.|3.5|2022-02-11 01:00:00

the queues were crazy and the amounts small. there weren't enough choices of breakfast as we don't eat pork products. there were no mushrooms either. the croissants were minute and bowls of fruit salad tiny. i was told there was no decaf tea and no espresso and no sweetener. the staff were lovely though, but very inexperienced. first morning our orders were a very long wait and wrong. dinner was lovely food wise, although not large enough portions. we waited nearly an hour, and had to ask 3 times when it'd be ready. some of the order was wrong, starter came after main course. the rooms are tiny..the door into the bathroom was very narrow. there is no air conditioning so it was too hot. maybe get centralised air conditioning. the whole hotel was too hot. all the guests we spoke to agreed. most of the staff are fabulous. many however are not experienced enough. the beds are lovely and comfortable. you need to put decaf tea in the room. the pirate ship is great but you need to tell families of all the facilities on arrival. many i spoke to were unaware. you should have a loyalty scheme, or accept the carer card to give discounts to vulnerable families.|3.0|2021-07-19 02:00:00
"we were here for father's day dinner. it's a cozy restaurant in a resort. while covid restrictions are lifted, the spacing between table were quite generous. loved the ambiance and our server was awesome - welcoming and sweet and just a nice guy to talk to!
good was great; father's day prefix meal (16 oz rib eye w wine and mash potatoes ) was really good. i should have ordered the same as my hubby. but the catch of the day - scallops on risotto with cauliflower was really good too. kids ordered the filet mignon and a roasted chicken. can't go wrong with filet but wow the chicken was super tender. it was half a chicken, huge portion and too much for my 15-year old to finish.
of course we enjoyed dessert too. bread putting which per my husband is one of the best he's had and my kids devoured the chocolate cake.
all in all, amazing father's day dinner."|4.0|2021-06-21 22:53:00

when we arrived we were told to go around the corner to the restaurant. arrived in the restaurant with no one to welcome us, we had to look for someone to seat us. we asked if we could start with a cocktail, they weren't very good, the espresso martini was very sweet. no recommendations from the waiter. ordered main and dessert, main was good, dessert was good, except the service staff let it down by not giving us cutlery for our dessert. we weren't asked if we would like anymore drinks. service charge was included. i think with a little bit more effort from foh it can be a great place.|3.0|2021-12-14 10:31:00

"i was staying at the proper hotel as guest for my birthday and wanted to celebrate the ""proper"" way. the unique blend of portuguese flavors with a california garnish can be found in each bite. my favorite dish was the prawns, light & delish, and the patatas bravas were crisped to perfection. the executive chef, chef chang sivilay, even took the time to bring a dish out to tell us about the menu which was so meaningful.
the ambience at 5:00pm was quite, comfortable and i enjoyed their music selection.

we were told ""we are fully booked for the night"" we left and opened the booking appt . there was seating outside available and tables from 1900in doors we booked and walked back in at 1900 after being told there was no chance of a table. i was really cross next time i'll look for a
hotel that doesn't recommend the charlie palmer and i probably should have complained at the time but couldn't be bothered with the lack of professionalism show last night.
i would recommend for the quality of the food but not the service shown by the front desk"|3.0|2021-12-05 16:04:00

lovely ambience and excellent service but a disappointing vegetarian offering. there was a delicious roast dinner but no vegetarian option. this was such a shame. we ended up having an alternative which was a vegetarian cassoulet which was not of the standard one would expect from a restaurant of this quality. we would love to visit again for sunday lunch with our family but none of us eat meat. perhaps the chefs could add a lovely vegetarian wellington to their offering?|4.0|2021-11-01 10:44:00

before we went into the winery we stopped in the beautiful renault chateau hotel across the street which is beautiful and a great location after spending an afternoon at the winery. every employee we met and spoke with was friendly, informative and truly happy to be a part of the renault team. the food was delicious as were the wines. the american champagne was crisp, dry and and i would put it up to many name brands in the liquor stores. we were given a tour of the property speak easy, glass museum and the future cafe. outside it is truly a winter wonderland with a skating rink and outside sitting area enclosed with heaters and scrumptious hot beverages - alcoholic and non a day wasn't enough, cannot wait to go back and bring my husband to golf while i sip and sit by the pool at the hotel - we will be staying for the night. and it is open everyday a great winter get away.|5.0|2022-01-15 18:51:00
close to the town and nice staff the area was still quite busy and our room overlooked the road. in the room at the other side across from us, there seemed to be people having a party, so it was kind of noisy. it was paddy's weekend, so i'm sure it's not always like that.|3.5|2022-04-01 02:00:00

the staff are really lovely, leisure facilities are basic. dinner was nice and breakfast was ok. i stayed in this hotel about a month ago, forgot to do the review! i had the family room and there was myself and my 2 children in room 101. the furniture in this room is old, the base of my bed was all torn, the carpet and curtains were grubby. there was a fan in the room and what i think was an air conditioning unit that was missing a legwheel so it sat slightly lobsided on a table alongside the fan. bathroom was clean, but fairly outdated, interior and furniture need an overhaul. this is definitely not a 4 star hotel.|2.5|2021-11-23 01:00:00
"great ambiance, but the food was ""so so."" ordered the rib-eye and was very underwhelming. onion rings are great, side dishes were good, but steaks are just not up to par for the pricing and class of steakhouse they are competing against."|2.0|2021-07-05 00:28:00
for those booking through booking.com - please be careful, your booking will go through and you will get a confirmation that all is order, but then if you have booked with a debit card, you will receive an email that your card is not accepted. if you contact the hotel they will tell you that you need a credit card not a debit card in order to book with them. it almost made me want to cancel the booking completely and book somewhere else. but we have called them and they took 50 eur as a deposit - upon receipt, i emailed them asking why they did not take the full amount for our night (115 eur) and they never replied to my email. and a few days before we arrive, while we were already on our road trip, we received another email saying that it was still not ok and if we did not provide a credit card immediately our booking would be cancelled within 24 hours, causing stress we really did not need. location is great as we had a train to take in the morning and not far from where we had to drop the rental car. the room was fabulous, very spacious and clean, with a coffee corner, a table, 2 armchairs. we stayed in for dinner and had a great view on the street and the railway pub. food was good and staff very welcoming and nice. the breakfast was also very well organized to prevent any contamination (coronavirus) and contact between guests. staff is actually very helpful. stayed in june 2021|4.0|2021-06-28 01:00:00

the room and location were perfect. it was our last day and we just needed a comfortable hotel close to the airport to fly home to the u.s. the room had separate bedrooms and two bathrooms. one bedroom had an ensuite. everything seemed brand new and spotless. the living room area is a separate room with a door, so someone could technically sleep there quietly. the views from our room (1501) were breathtaking from the kitchen and living room. the airport was just a simple shuttle ride away, which the front desk arranged for us. all in all - a very good stay as a place to either go home from or to rest before going off to another place. it is not close to the city center, which hopefully is clear to all travelers.|5.0|2022-12-08 01:00:00

easy parking with the valet in the front of the j.w. marriott hotel off of south college street in charlotte, (right off of i-277, great ease). the staff was attentive to our needs, and with the other guests at our table.

"for a restaurant in a kids-themed hotel, they didn't have an actual ""kids menu"" which i found odd. there were some lego challenges or something of the sort happening at the front of the restaurant, but we cannot see it from where we were sitting. there was not a huge selection on the menu, but i did love my pasta dish!"|4.0|2022-02-25 14:45:00
"my husband and i celebrated my birthday and each had wonderful meals. i stared with the house salad and had the chicken brie dish as my entree. my husband had the land and sea, a filet and prawns. tom, the waiter provided excellent service.
my disappointment is that you must request the delicious garlic bread that was once brought to the table without asking. there is also a process fee added to the bill, which covers a credit card fee that the business wants to push back onto the customer. it appears under the new ownership, there are some cost cutting measures taking place which may cause customer disappointed."|5.0|2021-11-21 08:19:00

my wife and i stayed one night in staunton's. staff were very friendly and showed us to our room as with the layout it would be easy to get mixed up. the room was a good size, larger then i was expecting from the pictures. the finishes and products gave the room the extra something. noise levels are a bit poor, we could hear the next room opening and closing there door and talking in the hallway was like they were in the room with us. same with people walking around in the floor above. i except its a georgian style building so there isn't much they can do. parking would have been great but city centre so can't be too critical, the q park at stephen's green is about 5 to 10 minutes walk away|4.5|2022-03-28 02:00:00

"first time staying in geneva and we always check open table for local restaurants with good reviews; livia came with a very high ranking and was within walking distance of our hotel.
we started walking about 90 minutes prior to our reservation to check out the local shops but it was very cold and we opted to get indoors so we arrived at livia much earlier; imagine our surprise when happy hour was in full swing!
we had a couple of special drinks at the bar (very healthy pours) then sat down for dinner. my wife had chicken limone and i had the shrimp and lobster fra diavolo; our server said the fra diavolo blew everything else away and he was spot-on (my wife has celiacs so conventional pasta is out otherwise she would have had the same).
livia reminds us of a classic supper club with strong drink pours and great portions at a fair price. livia is on our return list for sure!!"|5.0|2022-01-04 18:55:00
staff was friendly and helpful. we had time to visit the pool, we forgot swim caps and swim towels, but were able to borrow some from the reception at the leisure center. we enjoyed breakfast as the menu had options available and the food was really good. the hotel have their own restaurantbar on the premises and there are two restaurants within walking distance from the hotel. this is not within the control of the hotel staff and should not be held against the hotel. this is just something that fellow visitors should keep in mind and plan for during their stay. we struggled to find public transport links to the city center and opted for a 15min taxi ride instead.|4.0|2022-05-30 02:00:00

"i ordered a ""house"" merlot, served a very cold cabernet that you should replace with one of some merit. fettacunni was delicious. we came by to try the cuban fare but the menu was changed that day. your web page that day did not reflect the change.

we were visiting phx & staying at a nearby hotel. we were looking for a last-minute reservation and stumbled by sfizio, which was in close proximity and had availability. it was such a lucky find! the food was absolutely delicious and priced well (wine list, too). definitely it's a neighborhood gem, friendly, and we will certainly return during our az stay. the co-owner came over and greeted us, and during our conversation we learned that the restaurant had just opened 4 months ago. our server was super friendly and polite. all in all, it was outstanding!|5.0|2022-02-13 10:47:00
"we had a wonderful meal at acre 41. it started with the convenience of complimentary valet amazing for this neighborhood, right by ut campus. we had the cornbread (unmissable), belly-on pork chop, shrimp and grits, and creamed spinach and bread pudding all great and we'd order again. wine list was fine we liked what we had for the food, but not a reason to seek out this place. they focus on cocktails and bourbon in particular. cocktails were very balanced not too sweet.
our waiter john was helpful and informative!
this restaurant has slipped below our radar even though we live here. don't sleep on it as just a ""hotel"" restaurant.
we'll definitely be back next time, we'll probably come a bit early and grab a hh drink at the bar (do note: it's only available at the bar. i wish the restaurant had made that clear.
oh, make sure and make a reservation if there's a ut home game! smile"|3.0|2021-09-11 18:06:00

out of towner, was close to our hotel. i had the short rib ravioli which was delicious. it included a small tenderloin steak that didn't really add to the dish. it wasn't cooked properly- was waay beyond medium rare - but the rest was good so i didn't complain. the dish was tasty without it. arugula salad was very good, hubby had pizza and it was satisfied. good service, nice wine by the glass selections. sat outside under patio heaters, nice setting. more american than italian, menu was published on internet so check before you go if you are looking for true italian fare. still a good value.|4.0|2022-02-26 12:06:00

breakfast was excellent - really good variety and really well organised heated - unable to adjust the room temperature - stayed two nights but found the heat in the hotel meant the stay and rooms were uncomfortable. i was very disappointed at the service - travelled with our 3 year old child and was unable to order a plain ham sandwich for a hungry child to eat in the foyer at 18:30 . the solution offered was order room service and eat it up there , or move in to the restaurant so a small child could have a sandwich. just awful, my husband and i had already eaten. to be refused a request to provide a sandwich when we were sitting in the foyer which serves as a cafe during the day is hard to understand. also the room, i wanted a double and single bed, i got three singles. there was no fridge so i could keep a bottle of milk for our daughter chilled , i had to ring for ice to try and keep water chilled as the room was far too warm. that melted so our daughter got warm water in a bottle in the middle of the night. lastly i followed the instructions with the door sign to let house keeping know we only wanted fresh towels the next day and a bin emptied - got neither , no one looked at the room.|1.0|2021-09-15 02:00:00

"not our 1st visit here chose to to book here as it was our 51st wedding anniversary and previous visits had been excellent.
service the worst i have ever experienced . given the wrong menu as no one around us was eating we had no idea that there was other food on offer . when we found out that other food was available and questioned why we were not given the full menu and the daily blackboard the response was sorry . the service was so slow restaurant wasn't busy . the chicken in the chicken burger was dry tough and cold . when i went to pay they tried to overcharge me . when i pointed out that the menu we were given offered 2 courses for 11.00 . it was then we found out that they had given us the weekday lunch menu . we settled the bill after a discussion with the manager during which i told her they were going to get a stinking review . we left amicable but feel so let down that we are unlikely to return . i hate to give such a bad review but the experience totally ruined our anniversary lunch ."|1.0|2021-06-28 16:07:00

the rooms were spacious and tidy, good space outside if they kept to just residents. when we booked originally we asked to be booked into the restaurant for both nights stay. they did not book us in for the second night. we were then told at reception that we wouldn't need to book because residents get first call at the bar and restaurant, however the restaurant manager refused us a table in an incredibly rude fashion. when we eventually were given a table we were refused certain drinks which other tables clearly were been given, we were told we could stay and drink in the restaurant yet not 1 member of staff came near us. a really really poor display by the management team and by the staff themselves. the hotel should be embarrassed after we put the best part of 200 euro into the hotel over 2 nights. we were ignored, not cared for and were forgotten about and i would not recommend eating here no matter how good the food is. it really ruined our stay. the hotel also served drink after the 11.30 pm time to other tables but we were refused.|1.5|2021-07-04 02:00:00

4 stars only because we got there on time but still got seated 15 minutes later. i get they were super busy but folks with reservations should be accommodated. i got the andy's said fried chicken which was really good. the portion was huge. the bacon mashed potato that was part of it was amazing as well and it came with fruit and a lovely jam. i also had the iced banana latte and then later had the tropical guava mimosa and a bloody mary to end our breakfast. our server was super friendly and efficient. she took care of us really well.|5.0|2022-03-06 17:57:00
"- parking is ok - staff is friendly - gave us a refund for broken ac - hair dryer is good quality - sutton restaurant's meal portions are big - there was no chance to book a table for the outside dining area - room was facing an atrium that was bare and empty - ac was broken in the room, we notified the reception, and the immediate reaction to this was to get us a table fan. our stay was in the middle of the heat wave hitting 30c during the day. we asked if it was possible to get another room, to which the answer was that they get back to us. they never did. when at checkout we were asked how our stay was we mentioned the broken ac, and only then were we offered a refund, which doesn't really redeem 3 terrible nights. - on the first night kids were screaming and shouting in the above mentioned atrium even at 10:30 pm. since the ac was broken i could choose between roasting in the room with a closed window or listen to the screaming while i was trying to sleep - the bed was the worst bed i've slept in at a hotel. they advertise it as ""sleep easy"", while the springs basically push your kidneys out when you lay on it. it squeeks as well. i was considering sleeping on the floor."|2.0|2021-07-20 02:00:00

the only thing i didn't like was the car park was full all the time and we had to park in a public car park which is ok and costs only a few euro but not very convenient to be heading down in the morning before breakfast to put a ticket on the car . i think the hotel should organize a voucher for car while staying in the hotel as they do in other hotels . the room costs enough to include this if no room in the hotel car park . all of the staff exceptionally nice and were so helpful they went out of their way for their guests .one evening i was in the bar and asked a lovely girl if they sold crisps she said they didn't but would get me some in the staff vending machine . i dont know anywhere else you would get that service . definitely 10 10 stayed in july 2021|5.0|2021-07-06 01:00:00

"my wife and her mum had visited a couple of times before and had settled on their favourite - fish cakes (a starter) with a shared portion of chips which they ate as a main. on previous occasions there were two fishcakes each, this time only one. my wife queried this and a rather officious man came out to explain that one fishcake was the norm. it obviously wasn't a couple of weeks earlier. at least the fishcakes were nice.
prior to this fun and games we had ordered three drinks and they got the order for two of them wrong.
i ordered haddock and chips which was a mistake. the batter was not crisp and was a very pale yellow colour. if woodfordes wherry was indeed used in this batter then it was a waste of a good beer. the supposedly triple cooked chips were flabby and even the tartar sauce lacked flavour. pretty much a disaster all round.
we won't be booking again."|2.0|2022-01-02 03:38:00
"the cara hotel is a must-see in the sense that it is aesthetically beautiful and heavenly, feels like you've walked into your wealthy boss's summer house in the hamptons.
the food is overpriced for what it is but that's to be expected because you're paying for the ambience. i devoured the ceviche; it was sensational! as was the burrata, but the pappardelle pasta was not evenly coated in sauce and therefore lacked flavor. it mostly just felt like a mouthful of carbs that i had to douse in the meager sauce sitting at the bottom of the bowl to feel like i was getting a good bite. i didn't finish more than 14 of the bowl.
to keep it short - appetizers were amazing, main courses were not. maybe just come here for the atmosphere, a few small bites and a yummy cocktail and save yourself $400. but do come! smile"|3.0|2021-05-04 21:36:00

your drinks are honestly a conversation for jokes at the table. your prices go up, but your sizes get comically small. our wives ordered two margaritas which we were told were a decent size, then when they come to the table we all laughed at how tiny they were. this was the same last time we were there when the wives ordered other drinks. i even stopped ordering tonic water as it was presented as a hotel room sized bottle to pour over ice myself. your rising prices for drinks are inversely proportional to the decrease in what you get. if we go ahead we will likely just order water instead of what were essentially wide shot glasses.|3.0|2022-03-14 18:21:00

nothing i'm not one to write a review or complain about a service but this stay was simply unacceptable. myself and my partner booked in here as a trip away and were told to wait in the bar as our room was being cleaned. after an hour long wait we finally got to our room and found the carpet wasn't hoovered, there was hair and stains on the bedsheets and empty glasses outside our room. after kindly bringing this to the staff's attention, we were told to go back to the bar and wait for another room while having complimentary drinks. after another long wait, our second room turned out to have similar stains and hair on the bedsheets and food on the floor. this was then brought to the manager's attention and the third room has stains too. not only did we have to drag our bags across the hotel many times, we also wasted two hours of our time to get a clean room sorted for us. for a 4 star hotel that has signs about taking pride in cleanliness, this whole experience was just laughable. covid or not, you'd get a better and cleaner stay at a hostel! we got sorted with a complimentary 3 course dinner but the food wasn't great. we won't be returning or recommending this hotel to family & friends. sad to say our first trip away during covid turned out like this. thanks for deleting our review on google too!|0.5|2021-06-09 02:00:00

"sushi suite 202 was a great experience! the fish was de-licious, fresh, & beautifully and simply prepared. six of us (3 couples of sorts) had a great time and grew from strangers to comfortable fellow humans by the end of the evening. relaxed! did not feel rushed. did not feel scammed. no surprises. peyton our coordinator thoroughly explained the sake choices if we decided we would like a glass or a flight pairing. no pressure. the 17 piece ""course"" was plenty. though we definitely wanted to try the wagyu beef special offering at the end. the environment was lovely--swanky. recommend.
if you didn't want to add anything (drink or wagyu) you walk away with just the prepaid reservation tab and hopefully another 10-15% tip for the great staff. not sure what other reviews referred to. only bummer was that it was a bday surprise and wanted to confuse my guy by getting that key to suite 202 at front desk like the original concept had in mind. but they decided against this process for line times and covid. so you still check in at front desk at the hotel lincoln lobby, but then walk up to the 2nd floor behind the front desk and wait to be called into the suite. thete is a seating area there. it's still a surprise if you're trying to do that for someone by bringing them to a hotel and finding out it's a omakase dealy..! great sake..great cocktails--marco was a great mixologist. will go back and bring 5 other friends!! it only seats six (6) and chef aries said they have 5 seatings a night. we were the first seating @ 5pm ish."|5.0|2021-11-20 11:55:00

"they tried but came up short. they made a big deal about being on time (texted, emailed and called) for the reservation and threatened to charge us if we did not show but when we got there they stuck us at a table directly in the sun and when we asked to be moved they said those tables were reserved yet after 2 hours no one had come and filled any of those seats. also, they claim to be a fine dining restaurant but sat us as at poolside tables which made it impossible to dine on anything but appetizers. they have a mismanagement problem in that they do not service those that show up and are paying customers but provided better service to those that took reservations and never showed? seems to me you would want to take care of those that are paying clients instead of giving no shows priority? the wait staff was good but playing for a bad manager means the whole team loses. in order to get my business again they would have to make the following changesannoyedn
1. provide the best tables for those that actually show up for their reservation and do not save those spots for no shows - that is how you got lout of business.
2. replace the poolside seating with actual dining tables or change the menu to be a tapas restaurant instead
3 lower your prices as they charged as if they were vaca but they are a far cry from being in the same league as vaca
4 decide what this restaurant is going to be? is it a fine dining rooftop experience or a mid-level overpriced hotel restaurant with bad service and an experience that does not live up to the price.

nice starters, loved the shredded duck bon bons, pleasant helpful staff, nice atmosphere, warm and inviting newly refurbished, very clean, not too noisy even though the inn was busy, service was well timed, main meal of prawn linguine was lacking, needs to be more authentic, needs to blast the taste buds, bland i am afraid. main burger on the menu was very nice, well cooked and mouth watering, nice chips and a side dip.|4.0|2021-10-03 04:57:00

"excellent experience from start to finish. the moment we walked in the door, we were welcomed with open arms by the staff. the atmosphere was buzzing and music playlist was something else. everything about the black forge inn was phenomenol, from the service to the food to the exceptional attention detail put into designing the interior.
special shout out to stephen who looked after us for the evening. very attentive and great crack.
in particular, the carrot and ginger soup was top class. one last thing the badges and mints given after the meal was a lovely final touch to end a wonderful evening.
keep up the good work guys.
would highly recommend the black forge to all family and friends and can't wait to return."|5.0|2021-10-12 09:53:00

the menu was creative and the food was very good and could have rated 5 stars. however, the lower rating is due to the extremely loud noise level inside the restaurant. we booked the restaurant because it advertised outdoor seating. unfortunately the outdoor seating was not used on the 2 nights we ate there so we did not get to enjoy a quieter dining experience. we would not recommend this restaurant to friends if they want to be able to hear and talk to their dining companions, unless they could be seated outside.|4.0|2021-09-11 21:51:00

it was close to everything you need the rooms were dirty, had massive chunks of paint out of the wall. toilet wouldn't flush properly and the bathroom was so dirty. it's obvious that this hotel doesn't put their money back into the rooms. we requested a room with a double bed and a single bed, the request was accepted but when we got to the room there was 3 single beds so we had to push two together. we arrived around 11pm at the property so when we saw how our room was all we wanted to do was sleep, but within 20 minutes of being in the room the guests in the room across from us had tried to sneak two people in. one of the men from the reception went after them to confront them and it basically turned into a shouting match. i understand that's his job but we could hear every word that was being said at 11:30 pm. the next night was the worst night we've ever experienced, the room directly next to us decided to blare music on a speaker and shout out the windows from around 12 pm -3 am. i called the reception 3 times to complain and all she did was call the room from the reception. i understand that she was by herself at the reception and i'm nearly sure she was the only person on and the guests were most likely drunk but when i called for the 2nd time to complain an hour after (music still blaring) she told me she had called them and they said they stopped. it frustrated me that she couldn't just say that she has done all she could because we were hoping that they would stop much sooner than they did.|0.5|2021-06-28 02:00:00

"no acknowledgement of open table reservation. maybe30-35 persons in whole dinning area indoor and out. was seated anyhow on terrace.
restaurant is part of hotel. outdoor tent next to terrace had a wedding party going on with loud music and announcers.
twenty minutes for waitress to come by to take order. wine bottle came quickly.
appetizers were grilled octopus and warm brie with blueberries and pistachio with 4 half slices of bread. octopus was chewy and sticky. brie was great but insufficient bread. we had half of brie left and no bread. attempted to catch the attention of helpers and waitress when the made one of their seldom appearances, to no avail. brie was cold when finally we got someone to get some bread. they brought very dry toasted mini slices of bread.
when clearing dishes we mentioned our disappointment of food and service. waitress blamed covid and new servers undertrained.
table next to us returned their appetizers untouched to kitchen.
lobster ravioli for my wife and grilled salmon fir me.
ravioli were ok not much taste of lobster but were literally drowned in a yellowish cream sauce. my wife left half her ravioli. salmon was over cooked. burn on skin side served burnt side up on a bed of vegetable.
we declined dessert and any further drinks. asked for bill.
30 minutes later they came back asking about desert again and we said we had declined and been eating bill. waitress excused herself and came back with mobile card machine.
covid was again used as excuse for poor performance.
somehow my wife and i did not buy it. you can't operate a restaurant like this. at least have a maitre d'hotel or head waiterwaitress just supervising staff and doing rounds. make sure people's needs were being met.

"it's all about being bayside here. no one really comes for the food. the locals miss the old-school chili that the new folks have removed from the menu in the service of its ""seashore fish house"" concept. it's a shame. the long hots with caramelized onions is a fair substitute - they're quite right with the focaccia bread along side them. the steamed clams are utterly disappointing due to the continued misguided concept. our server mickey - she was quite good and made us feel safe and sound behind her protective mask - told me the cook serves the clams dry (as bones) without any broth (none) because it's the way ""they used to do it."" the 40 clams ($35) are served with probably a whole stick's worth of melted butter. frankly, i'd skip the greasy calories in favor the of the flavor of the missing clam broth. what do they do with, i wonder?"|3.0|2021-03-14 18:57:00

the ambiance was great. food was great. hostess was rude. my party ran 15 mins behind since there was a marathon going on and traffic to get there. we called tanners to let them know but no one answered. my friend showed up on time to check in but got confused since the hostess didn't greet her so she went to the treehouse by mistake to check in and it seemed no one knew how to help her actually check in our party. she got the run around. when we got there the hostess immediately pointed out that we shouldn't be seated since we are late but she will do it anyway. the server seemed stressed but he was nice. the drinks down stairs were amazing and i was told they were same upstairs at the treehouse but when i ordered the same drink they had no idea how to make it and told me the bar upstairs isn't treated the same as the bar down stairs, so they aren't given the same quality stuff to make the signature drinks. i thought that was very strange. i really enjoyed my time there but some of the staff and issues with consistency on the signature drinks made it less than 5 stars.|4.0|2022-02-07 20:02:00

for a 5 star hotel with only one vegan option on the menu it should have been a really good one, but no starter no dessert and a very bland and underwhelming vegan main, it all felt like an afterthought. we were expecting more considering these options are part of the main menu. the vegan breakfast was ok seemed reheated (hard hash brown and sausages) no plant milks or plant butters available. we wouldn't be in a hurry back.|3.0|2022-03-15 12:33:00

"the best thing about this restaurant is the ambiance. the rooftop was beautiful! unfortunately, the service was not up to par at the time of our visit. the waitress was sweet, but she was slow, disorganized, and inexperienced. for example, she had no clue how to open a champagne bottle and had to go get help. we had to ask several times for simple things like water and napkins. it wasn't overly busy.
i was with a party of 3 on a sunday afternoon. the plan was to order the 10-course brunch. unfortunately, one person in our party had medical issues so she was only able to order a-la-carte. the waitress informed us that the other two could not possibly order the 10-course brunch. so, instead of us paying $70pp for the brunch, we ended up getting $12 & $16 meals. this doesn't make sense financially for the business.. and i left hungry.
i would only recommend this restaurant if you are looking for ambiance and drinks. we did have a good time in that respect."|3.0|2021-05-04 22:05:00

"food was amazing! service was not the best. they told us there was a 90 minute dining limit due to covid 19 restrictions, but at the rate the service was going, we didn't even get our entrees until after 90 minutes.
we ordered 3 drinks - 2 zombies and 1 la girl. 30 minutes later the manager came to our table to tell us that they ran out of the mix for the zombie. he offered 2 comped drinks to replace the 2 zombies that were ordered. 15 minutes later the 2 comped drinks came. it took us another 15 minutes to find our waiter to tell him that we were still missing the la girl. my drink finally came out more than an hour later. this was after the comped drinks had come out.
i looked around, several tables who had sat down after us were already getting their entrees. i was livid at the fact that the comped drinks that were ordered after our original drink order was brought before my original order. our water glasses were also very empty..
as for the dine la menu, the ahi tartare and hamachi crudo are delicious! the scallop piccata has huge scallops and so worth it. the proscuitto wrapped chicken was maybe a 610. and the desserts are just okay. the strawberry orange puff has some weird taste that did not set well with all of us (we tossed them) and the brownie..it's just a regular brownie."|4.0|2021-03-06 23:24:00

we booked a table for 6 people + 2 dogs for a sunday carvery. good job we did - they were fully booked and not accepting walk-ins. we all had carvery lunch which was probably the best i've ever had. decent portion sizes (you can order small, medium or large) and meat was cooked to perfection. plenty of vegetable choice, yorkshire puds and gravy. our dog loved his too (you can order a doggy lunch of carvery titbits). not a massive choice of ales but doom bar and sea fury on tap satisfies most beer drinkers. the one problem we had was the very long queue to be served at the carvery. it meant not all of our party was eating together, but it was a case of unlucky timing. i would highly recommend the smugglers inn seaton for a sunday carvery but make sure you book in advance.|5.0|2022-03-07 22:19:00

however if you are looking for ambiance, and a classy dining experience this is not the place to go.
when waking through the doors of the lodge through to the dining room, the best i can say is that the lodge looks tired and a bit run down. it is stated that the lodge was rebuilt after a fire in 1981, and it appears that nothing has been done since then.
it is a shame because the property has such beautiful views over the mountains. i'm glad i dined there but for the money, i don't think it was worth it."|4.0|2021-11-06 09:48:00

i could have gotten my tea a tiny little bit faster for breakfast - but i am literally pulling teeth here - it was perfect. fabulous, always was. felt safe while also feeling somewhat normal - a hard thing to achieve in these strange times. stayed in december 2020|4.5|2021-01-18 06:00:00

the pig's nose has somehow managed the marvellous balancing act of providing a no-nonsense, traditional pub that is at the same time quirky enough and let's face it, downright cool enough, to appeal to just about everybody. the food is good, the beer outstanding and the staff patient and helpful. and if that weren't enough there's also the location.. throw the possibility of excellent live music into the mix and you have not only one of the best pubs in devon, but one of the best anywhere.|5.0|2021-11-15 17:23:00

"the waitress was horrible. she was a tall blonde large built woman and we were seated in a far back corner booth and sat one of our guests on a chair. then every
time she came to the table she kept asking that guest to move so she could place items on the table when she could have just walked to the other side. when she came to clear the table we had to pick up the dirty dishes and hand them to her because she said her arm hurt and she couldn't pick them up. she had a problem when we asked for separate checks and proceeded to lecture us about why we should have asked for this sooner. then when she brought the checks to us, she wouldn't process the credit cards until everyone was ready to pay and while she was waiting she kept coming to the table every minute to check. the restaurant was near empty so they didn't need our table and we all felt that she was trying to push us out. she then proceeded to keep bringing up the topic of separate checks and then told us that she ""loved"" us."|3.0|2021-09-27 01:43:00

sadly, the food was just ok, the server was sweet but highly untrained. for instance he'd come and fill one glass of iced tea when i asked not looking at the other two glasses of ice tea at the table that we're already empty as well, he could not keep the orders straight, are used to love coming to this hotel but honestly it will be quite a while before i would be coming back.|1.0|2021-03-25 16:12:00
the food was fantastic and large portions for a cheap price not just by vegas standards. we were seated early because there wasn't a line or a waitlist. my only complaint is that we ordered a coffee with a mug that the menu said could be taken home but the waitress swore up and down that it would be an up charge although the menu didn't say anything about that. our server also seemed to change moods once we had to remind her that we had asked for waters to go. besides that the food and atmosphere were fantastic, would highly recommend.|5.0|2021-05-06 19:35:00

property was clean and rooms basic but comfortable to sum it up i feel it's a case of false advertising this is a fairly reasonable 3 star hotel advertising as a 4 star which is most certainly is not. very basic rooms no bedside power sockets even if they retrofitted bedside lamps with usb it would be better. furniture and fittings all reminiscent of an ibis or similar no way this was 4 star quality. no toiletries everything very basic and functional and for 200 per night grossly over priced. staff were polite but a little off the mark in attentiveness and attention to detail. lobby cold and unwelcoming even though it was where we were expected to have e a drink. heaters and fireplaces in situ but not turned on. breakfast buffet again very basic and more 3 star standard quality and variety of offering not up to the mark. powered scrambled eggs no alternatives|2.5|2021-10-09 02:00:00

for a restaurant that charges over $20 a plate you would expect them to have brewed ice tea instead of only fountain tea. also, bread was extra. service was really good. food was average. overall it was overprice. but what do you expect when it is located in a hotel resort. maybe the pizza is a better value..maybe?|3.0|2021-09-20 12:25:00

food was good quality ingredients, service was excellent. however, i didn't like the 4% service charge for an unspecified reason (it was clear to say it would not be going to staff or covering something like credit cards, my party was under 6 people, etc.). if this restaurant is just opening then adding a nebulous fine to the dining experience instead of having it reflected in the menu prices shows poor planning.|3.0|2021-11-17 02:56:00
lunch meal proved to be tastier and more relaxing than all the dinners i have had there. the cheese bread was fresher and moister. the serving size for lunch may have been a bit small - not sure - but the prices seemed the same. the restaurant used to serve walnut loaf bread as a courtesy - now it is at a cost and i don't think it's even on the menu. the regular side vegetable has been mixed green beans on my last 4 visits. i'd suggest more options there to include carrots and corn and also to add a tropical (non-bottled) tea as an option.|5.0|2021-10-28 22:16:00

we arrived on time for our reservation, but waited almost 10 minutes before our waiter came to our table. he was very harried and seemed overwhelmed. the cocktail i ordered had a wonderful description, so i expected something fruity and refreshing. it was watery and had very little flavor so i returned it and got a martini that was excellent - though it was $10 which is quite pricey. the salad with a delicious dressing and steak was excellent and cooked perfectly. the dessert was divine! once the restaurant started to clear out our waiter became very interactive, but he wasn't for most of our meal, as we had to chase him down for everything. he never once stopped by just to see if we needed anything. the food was excellent but they definitely need to get more servers that can actually pay attention to the customers.|4.0|2021-07-15 15:19:00
"great vibe at the restaurant. food was all very good. lots of variety in the menu (but wine list needs help).
service was not impressive. staff was friendly, but hard to track down and quite slow. seemed like the staff was new to not only there restaurant, but to serving. prepaid for an expensive bottle of champagne ($200++) to be served when we arrived and asked for a good table to celebrate a birthday and was crowded into a table when two larger nice tables sat open our entire stay. took over 15 mins after being seated before we got said chilled bottle or any service. also bought a few other bottles of red which they dropped at table and did not pour. we placed a large order for food, lots of apps and small plates, many sides and a few mains all to share and just asked that the food come out as it was ready yet every single dish was brought out at exactly the same time so we couldn't fit it at table. just lots of little avoidable hiccups that made for some awkward dining moments."|3.0|2021-09-03 22:59:00

absolutely one of the best overall meals i have ever had. from the fresh loaf of crunchy bread, shrimp cocktail to the delicious, superb, outstanding steak, my wife had the steak and lobster..just excellent. it was our anniversary and they gave us an outstanding brownieice cream dessert - we were simply so full we couldn't enjoy it. highly recommend - 5 stars all the way!|4.0|2021-06-16 22:06:00
"went for a roast dinner. the food was really good apart from the lamb was so fatty it was almost inedible. a lot of it got left uneaten. also the potatoes were really leatherytough. a shame as these are my 2 favourite things.
one other negative was the music volume, it was so loud we struggled to hear eachother talking.
in addition the service was painfully slow and we could probably have finished 30 mins earlier if service had been faster.
apart from that, the rest of the food was lovely and the place and location was nice the decor was pretty. i had been wanting to try this place for ages and glad i can say i have now but shame about these few points.
i would say pricing is on the more expensive side"|4.0|2021-10-27 06:52:00

the location was just as we hoped and one of the reasons for selecting (part of a driving tour of wild atlantic way) and we appreciated the upgrade given on arrival the bed was extremely comfortable we were surprised there were no tea & coffee making facilities in the junior suite and the coffee we ordered from room service was poor (side note - no sign in room saying what number to dial for room service!) the quality of the gym and pool (which we had not expected to be open to non residents) did not match the quality of the hotel - some gym equipment was rusty. we had considered eating in the restaurant twice but were deterred by an almost totally replicated menu on our second night so just had a bar meal (though the burger was delicious !)|4.5|2022-10-01 02:00:00

if you're in need of some pre-ace theater dining, they usually have a table, which is nice. otherwise, you're in for a perfectly serviceable meal served by a well-meaning staff that vibes like it's everyone's first day on the job. ultimately, if there were a restaurant on the *other* side of the ace theater, i'd probably try to book a table there and skip the quasi-bistro 25 dollar hamburger routine.|3.0|2021-10-28 13:27:00

"we had an 8:30pm dinner reservation and were able to sit down right away. it was a group of 7 so we sat at the high top table for 8. restaurant was clean and had access to the holiday inn in cherry hill, nj. it was a little chilly because they have an outside area and the access doors were open. that was okay with me to help with open air due to covid.
we all ordered something different; chili wings, crab cake sandwich, chicken and shrimp tacos, salmon, cheesesteak rolls, the burger, the short ribs. everything was good and well-portioned except the short ribs, it could've been a little more. the drinks were good and the atmosphere was very nice. kyle was our waiter and he made us feel comfortable and his service was impeccable. i can't wait to go back."|5.0|2021-03-31 05:32:00

the food in the hotel was nice and it had free parking which you want in a hotel honestly the whole experience at this hotel was super uncomfortable from the moment we arrived. parking - when you first get to the hotel it was super hard to find the parking area and once you do there is two barricades..i believe both should be down and u need to press a button or code to enter however it was open so although the parking was free it was not secure. arrival- when my partner and i arrived at the hotel it honestly felt like a very outdated hotel however we where there for one night and thought we would give it a chance. when we got to reception neither staff member was wearing masks and no one greated us with a warm welcome again might of been a bad day so could get over it..secondly what tipped it over the edge the guy looked at my partner and saw he was also male and asked u know you booked a double which i said is fine..he then proceeded to ask again u know its a double? i said yes that's grand..when my partner walked up to put in his reg details the man asked a third and final time..u know i can get you a twin room which then my partner replied no we want the double room..i'm sorry but for someone at a hotel to make us feel uncomfortable as soon as we arrived is a joke. also for someone to work in the hospitality industry in 2021 and not be open and welcoming.to all guests no matter who they are is a joke..i just wish i had of walked away then because of the clear homophobia we experienced. cannot believe i gave this hotel my money i'm annoyed at myself for that. in the words of elle woods from legally blond 2 ' i forgot to use my voice.' with the clear homophobia from the start we did not get an 'enjoy ur stay' or anything it was just awkwardness and unfriendliness from the moment we arrived to when we left. resturant - with lockdown restrictions in the south we arrived late at the hotel we had to eat there otherwise it was outdoor dinning..|0.5|2021-07-15 02:00:00
this was my third time dining there over the weekend, and second trip in a month. i understand the shortage with labor so try to give grace as much as possible. most of the staff is very friendly and accommodating but there is one wait staff that is way too soft spoken and not very attentive. coffee refills were few and far between and were not considerate of the entire party. we needed to go to an empty table for more creamer and sugar. i enjoyed this for convenience and views but it is very pricy given the variation in food portions. i think this is nice to have, but as a hotel guest would probably opt for breakfast vs. brunch.|3.0|2021-09-06 14:29:00

we have stayed in the arlington many times over the past 6 years, mainly for the location, good bar and breakfast and the friendly staff. unfortunately this great hotel is being let down by the lack of investment in the rooms. since our first stay nearly 7 years ago nothing has changed, the rooms are dated, untidy and extremally hot. please invest in the rooms as this hotel deserves it, and especially for the price of a stay. always enjoyable due to the location, bar, breakfast and general feel of the hotel but we will unfortunately look to stay elsewhere in future until the rooms have had some tlc. you can now get better value for money in this location which is a shame.|2.5|2021-10-01 02:00:00

cool atmosphere and convenient for kids. my husband ordered a steak and it was good. my soup was like warm, and the kids fries tasted like it had been sitting for a while. i think our food was sitting out while my husbands steak was being made, because his was nice and hot, and mine and my boys food was luke warm. we also waited over 30 minutes after ordering our food. overall it is a continent place to go, we would probably go again if staying at the hotel, the kids had fun in it, but it's not amazingly great|3.0|2022-04-16 23:55:00

"friendly, efficient service. all four meals were delicious.
the haddock and chips was served on a board and although visually attractive was difficult to cut and eat when four diners were at a smallish round table.
just a small point in an otherwise lovely time but it may be something other people could find tricky."|5.0|2022-03-01 18:02:00

pros: valuable company to work for. relevant tools, training and functions facilitated by the brand via a centralized corporate system. freedom to self manage your time. if you are able to deliver result, you are not tied to an office time. challenging situations help you grow technically and personally. cons:the direction of the brand and the property owner does not match congruently several times. if the hotel management set the standard of the company, there are some cases the hotel owner shifts and interfered the strategy. this can cause a conflict to achieve the business target. as by nature of hospitality business environment, work life balance is poor. you are as a manager always on top throughout every communication channels. depend on the local working culture you must deal with inconsistent execution to perform. for example: delayed purchase items, which you need to implement do not arrive. lacking of english skills, nepotism, old equipment. unclear communication in terms of reportings, work orders and project due dates. ,|4.0|2022-11-17 01:29:00

two sets at 38, carafe of wine at 59, coffees, the usual pricey mineral water(!).. came tojust under 190 including a 15% service charge. pricey i'd say..but then the food was good, it's a smart hotel andthe waiter (kevin) was excellent.

this is a great new rooftop restaurant serving spanish inspired food and cocktails. it is modern, upscale, hip, and offers both indoor and outdoor seating with beautiful views of the city of anaheimdisneyland. the indoor and outdoor dining areas are both very specious with beautiful decor. the outdoor area also offers elegant firepit seating. the paella dishes and cocktails we tried were well crafted and delicious, and the service (from the hosts, servers, and manager yulia) was exceptional. we will definitely return with our friends and family. as oc natives who recently moved back to anaheim from los angeles (where we were surrounded by exceptional dining options), we have always felt that anaheim needs more dining options like blu skybar, so we are excited to have it near our home. we only hope that the quality of its food and service, and its current ambiance does not change (get ruined) over time due to disney tourism (as other disney area hotel restaurants have).|5.0|2021-05-28 20:58:00

great atmosphere. the view of the city from the rooftop at night gives an elegant experience. service wasn't necessarily next level but he was more than tolerable. given the limited space the area can get quite cramped once at full capacity. it's best to set your reservation and request for a table located at one of the two corners of the dining areas. with all said i as well as my guests enjoyed their meals and the rooftop experience. i would certainly come back in the future.|3.0|2021-08-30 04:24:00

pros: - working with the same clients over a period of time, seeing them grow - flexible schedule - good experience for the resume cons:so many. terrible pay for the work we do, they barely pay enough to keep a roof over your head. yet the director of the program is on the sunshine list! because of low pay, there is high turnover and most of the staff are young, just out of college with minimal life experience. the quality of staff has completely tanked over the years, and i have noticed an impact on the clients. there are a couple good managers, but most do not care about the staff; they are burnt out, work from home as much as possible and don't communicate well with staff. majority of managers have never worked anywhere else & aren't up to speed on best practices. staff are given minimal supervision, guidance or oversight. we have implemented new programs and practices without much forethought and these are not doing well. advice to management: be proactive. hire good staff. if someone is not working out, get rid of them before probation ends. ensure students are actually trained properly so they become good staff. have someone running support worker training who has actually been a support worker themselves. ensure all management are giving consistent information to staff. please hire a new director for the bunton lodge program, he is running it into the ground.|2.0|2022-12-01 01:22:00

"we had been brought afternoon tea a present. the food and the service were good. we even added a glass of champagne. it was a enjoyable experience until we went to settle the bill pay for the champagne.
on top of the champagne the added the following to the billannoyedn- an extra 10 because the price of the afternoon tea had gone up since the voucher was bought!
- an extra 10 gratuity which when pushed they conformed was optional.
needless to say we queried both and both were removed. and as a result we decided not to leave a tip.
as locals we did used to use the mitre hotel a lot up until around 8 9 years ago when the service food dipped and 'extras' starting appearing on the bill.
we had been looking forward to going back following its rennovation but left feeling that nothing really had changed."|1.0|2021-09-06 17:47:00

"if you eat inside it will be the loudest place you visit all year lol, i guarantee it. the inside decor is beautiful and the service is pretty good. the food is essentially bar food inside and out. it reminds me of the food you get at a high school soccer game, which can be pretty good, but most of the time regrettable. if you can grab a spot outside and catch the sunset and live music then that is what i'd recommend. don't feel like you're making a reservation for a better or different experience inside, not going to be the case. if you drink beer the craft beers on tap are the way to go. the mixed drinks seemed very ""weak"" as the kids say haha. inside everything is the same menu-wise, plastic cups, ketchup packets, the whole nine. sound deadening tiles would be useful i think. peep the floors inside too, they are sweet! expect $19 crab dip and wine in sippy cups..that would sum it up i think lol. the place is about as green as a landfill. again, post up outside, listen to the live music and just be thankful you have your health and a good sunset."|2.0|2021-10-17 12:00:00

we were really disappointed in our experience. we understand delays based on our current workforce clement but we had to ask for things multiple times like straws. the waitress took our order twice. we were supposed to get one of our entrees comped because it needed to be sent back and didn't come back until well after the rest of us were done eating but when the bill came out, it was wrong and had to be adjusted. it would have been helpful for things to be written if that would help keep everything straight. the time delay was not an issue at all, but the servers forgetfulness was more concerning. we then felt like we were being shooed out the door when the waitress came out and asked to get our dessert for us to go. not sure we'll be back.|2.0|2021-07-23 18:13:00

"the food was mediocre at best. bland. little taste. there are many options for mexican food in this area. i don't think they stand a chance.
we had the diver guacamole. it was fine. regular guacamole with pumpkin seeds on top. we tried the hamachi ceviche. it was so bad we had to send it back. it wasn't even ceviche. it was more like crudo with a horrid fishy under taste (like it wasn't fresh). we chose to replace it with the vegan ceviche. it was an odd grouping of veggies that didn't pair well. too many flavors that just didn't work together.
the chicken fajitas were tasteless. i would have liked if they had a dollop of guac or some salsa or something to give them depth. oh, and the table chips were bland. missing salt (or something).
our server was terrible. it was just a table of two. she chose not to write our orders down. instead, she had to come back and ask us for our drink order a 2nd time and our appetizer order a 2nd time. the bussers, though, were great. attentive and personable.
i get the restaurant is new, but dinner for 2 at 7:30 should not take 2+ hours when the menu is less than 10 items just repackaged, even with a full house.
we ate at their last concept, summer inn. we felt the food was ok but the service was awful and it was overpriced (bad value). the service is still awful, the value is better, but the food took a turn for the worse.
needless to say, not running back for more."|2.0|2022-03-27 17:36:00

for breakfast we booked online at the other hotel and nothing online said we couldn't eat free breakfast, and when we checked in no one said it was only for castle hotel. so walked over, waited in line for 15 mins to be told we would have to pay or go back to the castle hotel. very annoying, wasted 12 hr of park time. breakfast food was good though."|3.0|2022-03-31 20:19:00

the outdoor space is great and is the only reason why i would return. service was poor and indifferent. cocktails tasted good but were tiny and weak, so as to increase their margins even more. would not order again. we had two pastas ($20 and $22) and they were tasty. menu is limited. it's mostly about the outdoor ambiance here, nothing more. our bill after an 18% tip was $150 and the only food we had was the two main dishes noted above -- so beware if you order any cocktails or alcohol here. you'd be better off ordering a bottle of wine and sticking to that.|2.0|2021-08-29 20:48:00

from someone who spends 14 nights every month in different hotels around ireland, this is truly in my top 3. if you enjoy a great drink, delicious food, cosy clean rooms, comfortable bed, noise free rooms to the point that you could hear a mouse fart, chatty staff, this is for you. my only negative on this one is, i'm disappointed i didn't come across this sooner. the wood design within is amazing, and of course the fire design in the breakfast area is really well thought out. i can't fault this one, thumbs up to the owners can't wait to get back. very poor internet, but speaking to the owner, he mentioned there has been a new wifi installation and is on the way of fixing this problem throughout the hotel.|4.0|2021-08-11 02:00:00

"our family overnight stay at legoland castle hotel included free buffet style breakfast at the dragon's den restaurant and bar. reservations are required. i made reservations for 9:30 am on a monday morning as it was the earliest opening available. unfortunately there is still a long line and wait even with reservations. our wait time was approximately 45 minutes to be seated and that's considering the wait line had significantly reduced from when i had walked by earlier at 7:30 am.
we had approximately half an hour to pick and eat breakfast which was mediocre at best. many selections were already exhausted and not being refilled. if i were to visit this restaurant again as it's included in the hotel stay, i would book reservation as soon as i arrive to hotel and for the earliest opening available."|2.0|2021-10-15 14:20:00

the check-in process went really well, and we got the table we desired. then it kinda started to go downhill. ours first order of drink took a very long time to receive, and had to change one order since we didn't know they were out of a particular drink. we had the the poutine, which was delicious. when it came to entrees, we place our order and after about 5 min or so our server came back and told us that they were out of one of them after the fact. so my girlfriend had to change her order, on her birthday, but it took a bit of time since she was set on what she had ordered. since she was a bit flustered on top of the server pressuring her to choose something, she caved to something she really didn't want. i believe the pressuring was due to the fact that both entrees were put in and one of them was actively being made so our server was pressuring to get the item ordered to make sure they came out on time. so overall food was delicious and well excecated, but the service was lack especially for the pricing of the food and drinks. a meal of 4 drinks, 1 app and 2 entrees for 125$, the service should match.|2.0|2021-09-10 17:30:00

arrived about 15 mins early and was seated right away. on the way up the stairs noticed how nasty dirty the carpeting is. my goodness. sat down, took a good 15 mins to order cocktails then another 30 mins to order apps.. finally had apps over an hour later. apps were ok after we seasoned them with salt and pepper and lemon juice. oysters were very tiny. dinner came quickly after the apps and was fabulous. dessert was also very good. our reservation was at 7:30 and we left the restaurant close to 10pm. they really need to shut down and do something about the sticky nasty carpeting. if we go back it would probably only be for lunch.|3.0|2021-09-19 15:33:00

"we understand the issue on being short staffed.. as soon as we walked in (a group of 6) we encountered staff member who gave us attitude for being early. he stated ""you have a reservation or you 'had' a reservation"" and stared at us blankly like we didn't belong there. we shortly sat down and the waitress proceeded to give us attitude after being seated in her section. we then moved to the bar area tables where our waiter came over to us a total of 2 times throughout our entire encounter, to greet us and then to take our order. we had more communication with the bussers, food runners, and bartenders who felt the need to come over and serve us being our server was not doing his job. all of the members of the group we were with have been to this establishment plenty during busy season as well as off season and to say we are disappointed is an understatement. the food was subpar, and honestly hurt to chew. drinks were unimpressive and took long to come out, and we were not asked if we wanted another round or refills. many people in our group are also members of the service industry. we will not be returning."|1.0|2022-01-02 08:54:00

first, let me say i will eat just about anything. i am not picky and i'll even eat food that i don't like. the mushroom risotto was inedible. i think the mushrooms may have gone bad and i couldn't even choke it down. the restaurant took it off of our bill and offered to make something else, which we declined. the problem was that we were there for the show at the theater. we got to loam at 5:30, the service was really slow and when the risotto came, it was just too late to make something else. the drinks at the bar were great though.|2.0|2021-11-21 15:05:00

the beds were extremely comfortable, probably the nicest beds i've slept on in a hotel and the staff were very welcoming and friendly. the breakfast was very poorly made and the rooms were dirty. there were quite a few egg shells in the eggs royale and the salmon was too salty to eat. the pancakes we received were obviously microwaved (we literally heard it beeping minutes before our food came out), with the hard chewy exteriors and the condensation built up inside the fold. we also tried the fry up which was incredibly dry (dry sausages was something i didn't know was possible) and the scrambled eggs were overcooked and also dry. it's important to note that we were the first to breakfast and it was a while before the next guest came down on both days of our stay (as noted by staff), so there was no excuse for the food to be made so poorly. as for the continental, there were two choiced for bread (both sliced pan), the bread itself was so dry and stale, you had to pick from the back. there were no meats or cheeses either. for the cost, i definitely expected way more. the breakfast was probably the worst experience i've had out of any restaurant or hotel experience. as for the rooms, they were mostly clean but we found a nicotine inhaler and some wrapped sweets at the foot of the bed and under the desk!!|3.0|2022-02-14 01:00:00
restaurant is modern with a beautiful view of lake sarananc. unfortunately the service and food were poor. entrees were brought out before appetizer was even half finished. crab cake sandwich was thick deep fried breadcrumbs with very little crab. menu was very limited and servers did not check on table or refill drinks. dining room was very loud and echoey with only half the restaurant full. gave it another try for breakfast given we were staying at the hotel. they were out of pancakes|2.0|2021-09-21 19:51:00

"great location in the middle of pitt university!
beautiful new, modern hotel but with some unusual features.
as you walk in on the ground level you will be in a small vestibule with 2 elevators and a small valet stand - there is no lobby in the ground floor.
as you rise to the restaurant on the 10th floor, you'll exit the elevators, where there will be two small counters right in front of the restaurant where you can check in, get your keys and return down to your room.
the restaurant has a great feel with high ceilings, expansive windows offering terrific views of the campus and soldiers and sailors.
the space is well decorated in a modern, industrial chic vibe and the bar is central with a variety of tables to the left, a small outside terrace and comfortable sofas and chairs to the right of the bar.
we hosted a small dinner for six on a friday night recently. the hostess was friendly, accommodating us at a beautiful corner table with great views. the staff was attentive but the service was slow.
the menu seemed limited, a bit boring and confused as it featured summer salads and specials in the middle of november however, the drink menu had seasonal-appropriate, fall-inspires drinks.
the restaurant has some good standards and staples on the menu such as french onion soup, the burger, roasted chicken and the mushroom ravioli, all priced in the high teens to mid $30s. if you want a steak, be prepared to pay in the $60s for two options.
overall, really nice space, decor and views but unimpressed and underwhelmed by the menu selections, the service the and value delivered."|3.0|2021-12-09 01:07:00

disappointing experience for first visit. although this place is billed as a high end restaurant the ambiance is more at the hotel or las vegas casino restaurant level. on a busy friday night the staff were plentiful in number but seemed to be overstretched regardless. it took some time to have a cocktail order taken. drinks where good. food was just average for this price point. there are better steak venues in sf so probably won't return. the vegetarian option was a raviolo that looked more like something bathed in green slime. the steaks and desert were good. wine list way overpriced.|3.0|2021-12-18 16:45:00

the restaurant was fabulous, food was delicious and if i am ever in the area again, i would go there for dinner in a heartbeat. hello. we arrived earlier than expected (around 1pm) and we went thinking that we might be able to check in early and head out for the day. we were met with a very grumpy response of, 'there's nothing ready yet' and i asked if someone could call me when our room would be available. we heard nothing from the hotel, no-one called and we went back at shortly before 5pm and we were welcomed by a complete lady by the name of patricia. patricia couldn't have been more helpful and for a trainee, she couldn't have been more helpful. now i stipulate that i had not requested an early check-in when booking, but we thought we might get lucky. it was hope really, but i didn't expect the abrupt and rude answer i received either. the room was fine. lack of climate control or aircon was disappointing and we ended up having to leave the windows open the whole duration to keep the temperature in the room bearable. we also requested that the towels, tea & coffee be replenished on our 2nd day. they didn't even change the cups, nor make the bed. not the service you expect in a 4-star hotel.|2.5|2021-07-14 02:00:00

the location is beautiful on a sunny day. the food in the restaurant on sunday evening was lovely and james who served us was knowledgeable and very friendly. the staff serving out on the terrace were struggling to remember who ordered what and it was taking forever to actually get a drink and some food. a suggestion would be to number the tables out there so that they can keep track of their orders and make it a smoother experience for themselves and the customer. jacuzzi in bathroom did not work - very disappointing. (maybe a little apology sticker saying out of order would cover it so as not to spend time trying to figure out how to work it) breakfast was cold especially the fried egg even though the plate was extremely hot, i sent it back and it was changed for me to a new breakfast but again the yoke of my fried egg was freezing it turned me off|3.5|2021-06-10 02:00:00

my sister and i loved our recent stay at the castlemartyr resort. the grounds are beautiful and well maintained and pleasant to walk around. afternoon tea was delicious and the food was plentiful and felt like a special occasion. i would also highly recommend dinner in the bell tower restaurant. we enjoyed cocktails on the terrace. the room was spacious and clean with everything you need. however, the stars of the show was the staff. every single one we met from the moment we arrived until we left were genuinely warm, friendly and helpful. we look forward to returning. stayed in july 2021|5.0|2021-07-08 01:00:00

this review is for our breakfast experience. we returned to caldo verde after having stayed one night at the hotel a couple weekends ago. the huevos divorciados are delicious served with corn tortillas handmade by local vendors. i ordered a cappuccino and my husband ordered a drip coffee. both were good. the monkey bread was not overly sweet. made just right. fresh fruit was yummy. we even ordered a couple carajillos and although the bartender had never heard of the drink, they were made just right and without us knowing until after the fact. very accommodating. wait staff were super gracious. we'll be back for more breakfast and future staycations!|5.0|2021-11-07 02:54:00

"don't you just hate it when the hosthostess insists that you take the tiny table because you are a party of two and then proceeds to seat the next couple and then a single person in much more comfortable and larger tables. and, yet, i was the one with the rez.
i did request the bigger table with the comfy pillows but was asked to pick a smaller two top. of course, i didn't complain because..well..manners but i was with a client and i won't go there again."|4.0|2021-09-25 18:19:00

"this is a lovely old inn and we'd heard so much about mark hix. we were really looking forward to our lunch.
we had booked for the evening, but cancelled this booking and booked for lunch. we thought driving through dorset lanes in the dark might be a little dicey.
young servers attended to us, who did not have a good knowledge of the menu and struggled when asked questions. servers need to be trained. i suspect this again is a case of cheap wages in hospitality, which is not acceptable for any restaurant. we did feel sorry for these servers.
now for the food. the monkfish was tough. how can that be, but it was. my wife's brill was pink, not good and her scallops were rather like leather.
i don't know whether to laugh or cry at this! we were charged a 1 each for the jug of tap water. really! if mark hix is this desperate, then i'm at a loos.
finally, although we had cancelled the evening booking online and asked our server to confirm, i received an email from opentable chastising us for not cancelling. i've explained to opentable it was cancelled. this again does not bode well for the fox inn.
i doubt we will visit a mark hix establishment again. you live and learn."|1.0|2021-10-08 17:58:00
i would like to leave a review as we had a great time in this hotel. room was very nice,clean and fresh, without any problem. we had booked breakfast but we were eating there lunch and dinner as well. my husband is coeliac so we were afraid if his food will be gluten free without any contamination. i have to say, that each meal was perfect, he felt very safe and everything was so nice and delicious. each morning we asked for gf breakfast and he got it right from kitchen. same thing for lunch and dinner. all staff is so nice and very professional. i work in hotel and have 10 years experience and i have to say very well done to all your team! we definitely would like to come back smile no fridge in the room|5.0|2021-09-17 02:00:00

"had quite a sampling of their menu. the sea urchintuna was delightful. the mussel and fries was quite good, though i personally would have preferred crispier fries. i also rather enjoyed the charred peach. for entrees we got the veal chop and the strip steak. both were phenomenal. but the veal was a step above. slightly crisp outside, perfectly cooked inside. my partner ordered it, and i was a little jealous, as each bite was like brushing a cloud in heaven. but that strip was cooked perfectly. the red sauce was delicious, and the potatoes were nice and crunchy like i like.
we got the pine-abbey express and hudson royale. both were fantastic. the bartender picked us an excellent red to go with our entrees. i don't remember the name.
finally, for dessert, we splurged and got the pane cotta, the gelato (olive oil, coffee, risotto were the flavors of the day), the olive oil cake and the chocolate tort.
winners were definitely the olive oil gelato and olive oil cake. absolutely divine. i'd never had olive oil desserts and was blown away.
the chocolate tort was ""ok"". not bad at all. but the others were just so good.
shaneen was our waiter and andrea her second. they were delightful. we also had interactions with several wait staff and they were all very polite and welcoming.
well done."|4.0|2021-08-09 10:48:00

i did not feel that the cleaning measures were enhanced. our party was seated at a table that had napkins, cutlery and glasses at each place setting but slightly out of place and had glasses full of water. these could have been sitting there all day or could have been from previous party, hard to tell. i would feel more confident in the cleanliness if i was seated at a clean empty table. took extremely long for our server to acknowledge us. if we did not take it upon ourselves to get a qr menu code from another table, we would not have gotten a menu for a long time. disappointed given this restaurant is in a fairmont hotel.|3.0|2021-07-20 04:32:00

"brand new, the hotel is stylish without being intimidating, restaurant has yet (8th september) to open outside terrace, which could make it a fabulous venue.
staff are very friendly and efficient, training for the opening has obviously been thorough and they have recruited well.
kevin our server was superb.
the burrata, light and creamy, the orange dressing lacked acidity for me but my partner loved it.
fondue, couldn't fault it, rich, melting, nutty sweet, sharp and tangy.
lamb cutlets cooked perfectly, pink and moist, delicious.
turbot, very generous portion, we both found the chilli detracted from the flavour of the fish as the star of the dish, personal taste?
haricots, very large portion, otherwise perfectly cooked and seasoned.
we were desperate to try the mille feuille, but could not eat another thing.
wines were reasonable starting at 10 a glass, and available as 500ml carafes, the mucadet was clean, fresh, fruitier than expected, the rhone cairanne was beautiful, rich and smooth with red and black berry fruits.
the background mucic wasn't to our taste, sometimes making it hard to hear our server, and they are obviously coming to terms with lighting as the sun disappears, understandable in such a new venue.
overall a really great experience, we look forward to trying the set menu in december on our next visit, and we will be sure to leave room for dessert next time."|4.0|2021-09-09 17:32:00

initial greet at the table was uncomfortably long. they were not busy and i was dining alone, so it would have been nice to be asked about a drink. and then my order for dinner. it was clearly not busy so attention at the onset would have been nice. the decor is a bit tired and i was seated next to the exit door which to me felt awkward. again, the food was delicious.|4.0|2021-12-08 23:21:00

"the views, architecture, decor and floral arrangements are second to none, simply stunning. the high mirrored ceilings reflecting the entire dining room is an unusual befitting pleasure. the seating is absolutely comfy.
the well chilled, perfectly mixed rittenhouse rye cocktail was served in a beautiful, thin stemmed martini glass. the pear, apple, endive salad was missing matchstick apples. fried chicken was heavily battered and presented nicely but the chicken was dry. the accompanying spinach was just right. yellowfin tuna tartar was fresh but not exactly flavorful. it was overtaken by the sauce which was delicious but i would have liked to have tasted the fish. the trio of chocolate, vanilla, and honey ice cream was creamy on the palate, a nice ending to the meal.
i expected hotel silverware in this grand establishment but the service was flatware instead. one piece of china had the four seasons logo on it which made a scratching sound when touched by a fork or knife. another black dish made the same annoying sound. the servers are polite, attentive and unstuffy. and yes, i will dine there again with hopes the kitchen perfects its menu."|5.0|2021-11-05 01:50:00

the hotel is beautifully located on its own private grounds, surrounded by magificient gardens in full bloom, including the secret garden. the food in the restaurant was excellent and the staff were very helpful and pleasant. it was a very convivial and relaxing place. the location itself is in the country side but ideal as a base for visiting connemara. it was a pleasure to sit in the garden and listen to nothing but the sound of nature. a real treat. nothing really.|4.5|2021-07-15 02:00:00

"six of us had a family group lunch there on sunday. we decided to sit outside at a picnic table so the hard benches without backs were to be expected. a sun shade would have been nice as it turned out to be quite sunny.
the food was delicious but a bit scimpy in terms of some of the portion sizes. my wife's john dory was decidedly on the small side as were the two starters my daughter decided to have. the desserts were very tasty.
overall a pleasant experience but not exceptional."|4.0|2021-09-15 10:58:00
beautiful hotel immaculately clean. staff are eager to help very friendly and welcoming. the food in blake's restaurant was delicious. only thing i can fault and it is minor was the food in the seven bar. i ordered the sweet potatoe burger and it was just that. mashed sweet potato between two buns. it was tasteless very bland but my partners food was lovely.|4.5|2021-09-03 02:00:00

the breakfast was fresh and i really enjoyed it. i paid extra for an executive room and was supposed to have a robe and slippers but they were not in the room. i just left it and said nothing as i didn't think it was a big deal at the time. but then myself and my partner went down to the bar as he wanted to watch the ireland rugby match and despite us staying in the hotel we were told we couldn't sit in the bar or get food as the tables were all booked up by people not staying in the hotel. so we had to go to the room and watch it there. we went to the bar for dinner then later that evening. i ordered the fish and chips and from the taste i could tell the oil the fish and chips were fried in was old. all i could taste from it was oil and my plate had a pool of oil on it from the fish it's self. so i just had the soup in the end. myself and my partner then continued to have a few drinks but the service was slow and we had to keep going to the bar to order as we would be sitting with empty drinks for a few minutes and no one would come to ask if we were okay. the next night we decided to go out for dinner and come back and have some drinks. but again the service was slow and the bar man at one point had a problem with making the cocktails which made us feel uncomfortable ordering them then. the first night we were asked if we wanted any last orders before the bar closed so naturally we thought the same would happen our second night but it didn't so we were exactly overly happy with the fact the service was slow, we were made feel uncomfortable with our drinks orders and then that we were not asked for last orders. overall i was really looking forward to the break away as my self and my partner work really long hours and rarely get a chance to go away with each other. but the experience was not at all what i expected. i was and am so disappointed in the experience. the hotel staff seemed to be more concerned with the people walking in off the street, which is fine but as hotel guests i expected more.|1.0|2022-03-01 01:00:00

"our visit was a surprise meal and overnight stay for my partner, and she absolutely loved it. as did i.
i would like to make a special mention about a lovely young lady on the desk. her name was nina, and she was the epitome of excellence in every way. she was pleasant, smiling and very welcoming, helpful in so many ways and simply a delight to deal with. having been in retail management for many years, i know the importance of good customer service and attitude, and nina and the rest of the staff were the perfect example of how it should be achieved.
we both look forward, very much, to our next stay at warren house.

christmas brunch. ordered mimosas and iced tea for the 3 of us. mimosas didn't arrive until well into eating. then had to track down our waitress for the iced teas. it was a buffet, so we helped ourselves. our waitress never came back to our table. we had to go find her to get our bill and was shocked to have 20% gratuity automatically added. no wonder she didn't put in any effort. food was ok, but definitely not worth $57 per person and only felt like it was a minor step up from their usual brunch. we were very disappointed.|2.0|2022-01-05 09:55:00

"breakfast staff very good and pleasant. some reception staff pleasant. parking facilities were great. management. the room i had booked (suite) was not available on the evening i arrived. a long conversation ensued at reception where i was told (in a friendly manner) that i must have booked something else and that it would be checked and sorted out first thing the following morning. instead of hotel sorting out a quick transfer to suite the following morning, i had to search the manager (11:00 a.m.), explain the situation and wait for a further 3 hours to have access to my booked room. when i told this lady that i expected not to be charged for my first disastrous night and day in the hotel, her response to me was ""now why would you be saying that?"" - incredible! on the evening i arrived, i informed the receptionist that our preferred breakfast slot was 10:00 a.m. only after questioning the breakfast chef on the third day about the dried out breakfast did i realise that it was necessary to inform reception five individual times of our preferred breakfast slot - crazy! on our last morning at breakfast there was a woman carrying out a very loud and disruptive zoom meeting in the small breakfast area where the only tables set for three were available. why was she not asked to move away from the dining area? i am aware that the hotels in ireland have not been open for very long following the covid lock-down. nevertheless westgrove hotel must realise that visitors (especially from abroad) expect better. my stay with my family at your hotel was very disappointing."|3.0|2021-10-23 02:00:00

"the setting looks like a (pretty) cafeteria with no booths and all open seating - we prefer more intimate dining but probably great for corporate staysfunctions within an otherwise business-oriented hotel.
the food was just ok & hurt by the mess-kit-style plates with high edges. hard to scoop out grits etc without a spoon, of which there wasn't one! portions are small, but the prices are also reasonable (food & wine), especially considering this is hotel dining.
the devil eggs were from some small creature i'm sure i wouldn't recognize. too spicy a topper as well.
ravioli was too sweet & too many pecans."|3.0|2021-12-17 18:09:00

the restaurant is attached to a hotel. there was no obvious reception area upon entering the venue. our party of 4 probably spend about 10 minutes trying to seek staff attention to be met by a group of very disinterested looking teens by the coffee bar at the far end. after a shaky start, we were sat down at our table and the food thankfully was sublime! very interesting dishes, ingredients and flavour combinations. dishes arrived at a good pace. we left full and happy! would recommend this place, provided you find someone who will serve you.|4.0|2022-01-22 19:44:00

"from the moment we entered the hotel we knew it was going to be a memorable evening.
every member of staff from the doormen to our amazing server maria were professional, attentive, knowledgeable and took time to genuinely get to know us and our preferences.
maria spent much time to advise us on the menu options as did the sommaelier which resulted in an exceptional meal from start to finish.
the food was a twist on some classic french and italian dishes with outstanding flavour, texture and presentation. cooked to perfection and served with style.
maria and team then booked us the perfect table in the stage bar (and transferred our bill seamlessly) for us to enjoy after dinner drinks and live music.
the talented adam and alex did a number of terrific sets and took requests. they also like the other staff made time to meet and chat with us. all the while the bar staff served us (few too many our bad) cocktails.
the hotel has stunning interiors, outstanding fooddrink and a great location.
but the reason we're coming back is the people.
all staff are hands down best in class here in london.
just one of our best nights out in 2 years honestly.
our thanks.

we were looking for to our first dinner here with friends and once we arrived we were constantly rushed. the server just kept coming back and pushing us to order, then pushing us to finish, then pushing us to pay. we were trying to have a leisurely evening with friends but it turned in to a spectacule of us trying our best not to let him rush us, it was very uncomfortable. he also brought my husband an appetizer for dinner instead of the duck that he ordered and proceeded to argue with my husband about his order. we already had two of the appetizers that he brought to my husband. the location was great, the restaurant was beautiful but none of that matters is the service is horrible. i don't mind the cost but if it doesn't come with good service, i can't recommend this place.|3.0|2022-03-14 14:22:00

10 for decor and ambience both inside and outside but a 6 for food and drink. their beer and whiskey selections are akin to what you find at a cubs game and not a primo american bistro. vodka on the rocks was watered down. they give you a cheap laminated menu at your table. food offerings are good but simply taste average. flatbread was doughy and bland. cauliflower had a nice spicy buffalo profile but was not crisp on the outside considering it was fried. lobster roll was drowned in mayo and fries were lukewarm and what you get at a local hot dog stand that does not make their own fresh cut ones. salads looked appealing but simply did not deliver in flavor. one and done for our crew. service was average but i forgive this considering how challenging it is to be fully staffed. don't believe the hype.|3.0|2021-09-05 17:59:00

downtown slc has a lot of great restaurants and this is not one of them. this place is a joke. i reserved patio seating to take a friend out for his birthday (which email confirmation explicitly says so). upon arrival, the first hostess said our table was a high top indoors. i mentioned i booked an outdoor table and she implied that i booked incorrectly. it wasn't the customer is right. in fact, the story seemed to change from i didn't book right to that an outdoor reservation didn't really mean that because it was really booked for other people. i guess my friend and i weren't pretty enough to sit at one of their coveted patio tables. after this disagreement we were finally led to an outside table but with a lot of attitude from the hostess. the food and server were good but just an overall bad experience. skip this place and patronize better and less uptight restaurants in the downtown area like lake effect, white horse inn or whiskey street (just to name a few).|1.0|2021-09-24 07:35:00

perfect location for getting to the airport. lovely decor, lounge and restaurant. a few vegetarian options on the lounge menu which was great. the bed was really big and comfortable as was the shower. you could cast your phone to the tv or even sign into common tv apps like netflix and disney which was a great bonus, as was the complimentary water on arrival i couldn't adjust the heating settings. everytime i did it would default to the original setting shortly after. with the floor length window it got quite cold and there was no second blanket. that being said we didn't approach a member of staff about it to give them an opportunity to help as we just wanted to get to bed asap for a really early flight. the directory in the room said to adjust heating via turning the nob on the radiators but that appeared to be outdated and so probably needs updating. a shower cap would have been welcome also but i couldn't complain much about less plastic waste! the staff were lovely, as was the room. you could hear traffic outside from the second floor but it was fine. i would definitely stay here again!|4.5|2022-12-17 01:00:00

the room was recently renovated. the location view from and size of the room was excellent. we arrived early and the helpful receptionist took my number and contacted me as soon as the room was ready. all these positives were unfortunately overshadowed by the experience at breakfast. this is not the normal hotel breakfast experience. seated in a cold dark restaurant area at the rear of the hotel. we were asked for our room number. we ordered from a menu. everything is charged as extras. we paid 6euro for two cups of tea. i asked if toast was included with breakfast and was told it was. one slice of toast was included. extra toast ordered cost 1.75 two slices. total cost of breakfast was 32.85euro for two people. poor value for money.|2.0|2022-03-20 01:00:00

overall this was a very good dining experience, but i cannot rate it 5 stars based on: the service in getting cocktails was a bit slow, the entrees seemed to come out almost too fast with some cold spots on the fringes of the enchiladas i ordered. i wondered if they had been microwaved. also, i'm not sure live entertainment is the best choice each night. i would have preferred some lighter background music as the location outdoors is so peaceful. i found it somewhat challenging to have a conversation with my date. while the entertainer was excellent, the music was a bit loud.|4.0|2021-12-07 20:21:00

"not worth the visit. yet.
waiter was too fussy, napkin handing is totally unnecessary, menu explanation was annoying and ""man-xplained"".
tina carpaccio was v small. but good. beef carpaccio was fine; but dry. fish pie was fine, but too much potato and not enough fish, would be better if the dish was better balanced in terms of filling and then priced more.
deserts were the show piece, outstanding french toast dish, and fantastic homemade beignets. (even if they did take 35min to arrive).
overall it was good, hostess was fantastic, but could be much much better. restaurant music was typical hotel lobby, could be better suited by frenchjazz cafe style music in my opinion. room not ""atmospheric"" enough. wait times for the food were far too long.

lovely hotel, well situated. reception staff very efficient and helpful. good sized room with very comfortable bed, bathroom clean and well equipped. tea and coffee facilities in the room too. we dined in the bar, really enjoyed the fish. bar had a nice ambience about it too. breakfast was well served and plenty of choice with a self service for the juices, cornflakes, toast, pastries etc and then cooked breakfast made to order. would certainly recommend a stay at an grianan hotel. no complaints.|5.0|2022-07-14 02:00:00

our server, natalie, was great as were the braised short ribs. thanks for the special dessert to help celebrate our anniversary. the only problem we had was the noise level from the kitchen while in our booth (i think i heard 23). we could hardly hear ourselves talk. the lesson for us is to make sure we ask for a table away from the kitchen, even if we have to wait.|3.0|2021-12-01 13:04:00

"i was there for breakfast by myself. the food was very good. my server was pleasant and polite but very slow. guests who had come in after i was seated were done and leaving quite awhile before i got my bill.
to be fair, i was there for breakfast a few days earlier with a group of six. our server that day was absolutely awesome.
they have great food, very generous portions."|3.0|2021-05-02 02:54:00

don't expect a side salad and rolls as a starter as they don't exist. all of their steaks have zero sides so you pony up for that as well. disappointing that they have no baked potatoes, just mashed and french fries. with that said, my end cut 10oz prime rib was excellent as were the side asparagus. my wife enjoyed her stuffed flounder. they have a nice covered outdoor area as well.|2.0|2021-09-29 00:07:00

total disappointment. the turkey tasted as if it came from a can . it was all chunks of turkey. they ran out of pumpkin pie at 5:30 pm so we had none . one of our invited guests had a large turkey bone on her plate instead of turkey. once we were able to bring this to the writers attention, they brought out a few chunks of turkey o a small plate which she refused to eat. our waiter was absent and we had to keep asking other waiters for help. we are so disappointed in the deauville that we will not return.|1.0|2021-11-26 21:12:00

arrived at 6pm only to be told there was no booking and to just find a table anywhere, bare in mind there was 6 of us including 2 children. which is why i made the booking, i did ask what was the point of booking only to get a shrug of the shoulders from the girl behind the bar. we would have left at this stage only we had walked to the hotel and my husband is just finished chemo and was tired. we ordered our food and a bottle of wine and drinks . the wine was off and they did offer to change the wine but we declined. they took it off the bill, the food when it came was lovely, but the 2 children which were with us had to wait a half an hour for their dessert, they were only having ice cream. the manager did come over and apologised for the delay and didn't charge for the dessert. the whole evening was ruined at that stage. needless to say we won't be returning. the waiter that served us was nice and friendly. but overall not a good experience and not a good ending to our holiday in galway.|1.0|2022-02-25 08:48:00
room was clean. shower was nice with good pressure. i enjoyed the food we did eat in the bar. our stay was fine. the restaurant wasn't open midweek. there doesn't seem to be enough communication between waiting staff as we got asked a number of times by different staff whether we ordered, which is fine but then after we told them we weren't eating some other staff member brings out cutlery and lays it on our table. we said we weren't eating again. at breakfast the young staff member collecting used dishes was way too eager. i only put my fork down and he was over taking my plate. i wasn't even asked if i was finished my toast and it was gone. the individual circled the room and hovered which was off-putting. pity there was no pool either.|3.5|2021-07-17 02:00:00

"we came for our 15th anniversary dinner. the cocktail ""fireside chat"" was wonderful. we had a blue corn tamale tart with smoked trout and tomato preserves that was unique and good. the three sisters salad was wonderful. the bass was absolutely fabulous but the quail was ordinary. for dessert, we had the flourless chocolate torte and it was also very good.
overall, the meal was good. the place looks like a hotel restaurant - pretty underwhelming in decorstyle but good experience on the whole."|4.0|2022-01-02 18:39:00

"first time visit (before kings hockey game - very close - 12 mile - to staples center)
diverse menu - service was good. bus-boys ""cruising"" the dining room to check if you are done your meal was annoying.
entry process is flawed. you arrive at valet and attempt to enter the hotel lobby. a security person directs you around the corner to another entrance to see his colleague. this guy then checks to see if he can find your reservation on his i-pad. he then escorts you to the lobby elevators, where the original security person greets you to take the elevator up.
can't understand this unnecessary process."|5.0|2021-11-21 15:13:00

"the service was great. laura was an amazing server - so friendly and professional! she made our experience topnotch!
the food was less impressive. the thai beef salad (special) was not very authentic and that would have been okay, but it just didn't taste very good. a real disappointment. my friend had the crab and lobster ravioli which she said was just ""alright"" and that was it.
our experience was overall positive, though, because laura did all she could to make our visit wonderful, even getting us chairs on the deck or terrace by the river, for after-lunch drinks, that we were originally told was closed."|4.0|2021-07-30 18:12:00

room a bit small for a deluxe room - the location of the hotel was just perfect - and breakfast was great (no bacon on the full irish though) other than that wonderful well with covid19 i realize that there are some measures in place - however we did not book a table before we checked in with the result we were told that there was none available and we would have to go elsewhere for food and a drink (they did offer takeaway drinks) but having traveled from offaly to be told we could drink in our room - no way. very disappointing as we have stayed there several times. we did manage to get food elsewhere and had to stay outside until 21:00 we went back to the hotel at that stage and we tried to get a table and there were several free tables available so i was a bit mad at that, as i gave my phone number to the receptionist who promised to phone me if a table became free|2.0|2021-06-17 02:00:00

the dragon's den is about the only game in town if you are staying at the legoland castle hotel. each hotel has its own restaurant. you can eat at either hotel i guess, but the castle hotel is set up for you to make easy reservations at the dragon's den. to go out of legoland would require quite a drive. the food is typical for a theme park. it's expensive, but the food quality is okay. there are a lot of small children there, so you have to go expecting this. it's not a quiet adult type of restaurant. reservations are required, but are easy to make off your smart phone with a qv reader. when you enter the hotel you are given a one page sheet full of these codes and they are used for almost all of your contact with the park and the hotel, so be sure to have a reader available on your phone. the staff are all very friendly and helpful, so if you have a problem you can go to the restaurant staff for help.|4.0|2022-03-07 22:39:00

we went to the roebuck inn on fathers day. it was lovely to be told that the fathers got a free half pint! we are vegan and the food was amazing! the vegan roast is an absolute must have. we had a sweet potato and mushroom nut roast - which was absolutely delicious. my husband and i aren't even great lovers of mushroom and we couldn't get enough of it! the roast potatoes are cooked perfectly. i would eat that roast every day if i could! the staff are super friendly and attentive. i cannot wait to go back !|5.0|2021-06-22 11:36:00

we came for the easter brunch, family of 4. we enjoyed the seafood, charcuterie and clam chowder soup. however, the carved meats were not seasoned well, if not at all. the crepes were hard and it appeared to have been left in the chafing dish which was disappointing. the pastries were stale and quality was again, disappointing. i would have been happy to pay what we paid if the quality and taste of the dishes were above par. i was looking forward to giving a 5* review but i'm sorry i cannot at this time. not a bad experience overall but not excellent. needs improvement!|3.0|2022-04-18 00:52:00

"well, i am going to start mentioning that i really like the place but this is the first time i will give a negative review, i always try to look for the solution first.
in this case, i went to have dinner with my family on sunday january 16th, overall service and food was good. i requested the bill and ended up paying $250, transaction was reflected on the 19th on my bank statement but on the 24th they double charged me, another $250. i attempted to call the place as soon as i noticed but was informed that restaurant open at 5:00 pm, i waited and called back at 6:00 pm, i was transferred to the ""manager"", she got all my info and ""apologized"", (which i understood, it happens, i guess), she told me she will give me a follow up call the next day to fix the issue, that call nacer came in. i gave her 2 days, i had to call back at same hour and could not get a hold on her, supposedly that those matters have to be solved at the financial department and needed to call back at different hours. long story short, it's february already and still haven't had this issue solved and i had to come here to write this bad experience."|2.0|2022-02-01 18:59:00
central location was super, a very short walk to the area where it was all happening check in was the worst i have ever experienced and i've traveled extensively. unfortunately, we arrived in rush hour, in nose-to-tail traffic for about 40 mins getting to the accommodation. when we arrived we discovered the last guest in had parked badly, leaving us unable to get into the last remaining parking space. (i had informed the accommodation of our pending arrival and it had been acknowledged so you'd have thought they would check the parking situation) we had to stop on the cycle lane to unpack our bags and a passing pedestrian had a row with my husband about it, although he could see i was frantically unpacking our luggage from the boot. my husband then had to rejoin the nose-to-tail traffic to find out where to park. once in the accommodation, i then tried to express to the girl that we fairly urgently needed to see if the guest was around to move the car but she kept saying 'she thought he was and she would ask' but then proceeded to ask for payment etc before she checked to see if the guy was available, and all the while my poor husband is driving around in rush hour traffic clueless as to whether he needs to find parking elsewhere or not. the car was finally moved, my husband was able to come back and we got parked. the room was clean but very poky. the bed was tiny and like a torture device, and 3 days later my back is still sore. it was brick hard, and you could feel the springs. the duvet was really heavy, so very hot, but if you threw it off, there was just a sheet, so you then froze. the pillows were so thin as to be virtually non-existant. and the whole place reeked like someone had boiled dry a pan of potatoes. i'd rather crawl over a dead body than stay there again|1.5|2021-10-04 02:00:00

"i booked a table for 6 for a 30th birthday celebration a long time before lockdown was relaxed. when we were told by boris we could go inside to eat (who wants to sit outside possibly in the rain?) i called to see if we could be moved inside, bearing in mind this was a 30th birthday and one of my group was 90? my call on the answering machine was not replied to. i phoned again next day and was told that all tables inside were taken!
i would have thought that those, like me, who had no option when booking but to be outside might have been bumped inside, but not so apparently.
i can't blame the pub for the wind and rain, but the umbrella on our table was not large enough and two of us were going to get wet.. and did. there were some other tables with heat lamps.. but those were all booked too.
the food was 'ok' - basic pub fare, nothing outstanding. but we waited an hour between starters and mains and were told the reason was most other tables were going straight to mains. well, why not let them wait?
so as we were cold, damp and miserable we didn't bother with the puddings or teacoffee."|3.0|2021-05-27 16:29:00

the food was great. the room was nice and comfortable. the bed was very comfortable. i needed to get a shuttle to the airport at approx 3:30am. specifically, only two shuttle buses were operational and since 2 buses were allocated to flight crew at that time and normal passengers could not board these buses for security reasons, there was a 40minute delay (approx) in getting to the airport. the staff at reception really didn't seem to care. i was lucky that i had allowed for extra time but many had not not and were not impressed. the hotel should check when flight crew need to use the shuttle buses and plan accordingly (extra buses etc) as it does not look good and leaves a bad impression after what was a nice stay otherwise. it is the last interaction a customer has with the hotel and should be managed accordingly in my opinion|3.5|2022-05-06 02:00:00

a little above average butits a hotel restaurant. i don't mind spending but he food must be worth it. my palette is very broad and will only be returning for drinks in the future."|2.0|2021-09-06 22:23:00

visited for the second time with a group of friends. first visit was lovely. this was poor. admittedly valentines weekend but at 4pm they only had 2 or 3 other tables. dietary requirements were all met but the service was poor. at no point did staff ask if we'd like to order more tea (we were there 4 hours!) we weren't offered water, and while the food was lovely the gluten free sandwiches tasted a little stale. biggest issue was the bill. we had to ask for it several times, paid and then they came back to say we'd underpaid, they had increased the cost because it was valentine's. we had to point out that we'd booked on an offer and then wait quite some time to have 100 refunded. hopefully just a blip, it is a beautiful setting but i'd think twice about returning|3.0|2022-02-13 18:55:00
"we had an excellent meal with very friendly service. unfortunately this was spoilt by an enormous amount of people coming in after about an hour to attend a wake. the noise level rose enormously and we found ourselves sitting in a wind tunnel due to people going in and out and not shutting the doors. i fully understand why venues have to be chosen for such events and that it is a big source of income for the pub, but, in my opinion this pub is not suitable because it doesn't appear to have a separate function room and such large gatherings are to the detriment of diners.
a pity as the meal and presentation were excellent."|4.0|2021-11-01 11:55:00

"location. dinner both nights very good. very good breakfast. bed really uncomfortable. mattress needs replacing immediately. phone not connected in room. empty shampoo bottle left on top of shower from previous guest !! rooms obviously not cleaned or checked properly which is a great concern. no shelf in shower, just raw plugs. cleaners entered to clean room and did not replace used towels just hung the used towels left on the floor on the back of the door. have never come across this being done in a hotel before. got phone call from anna in reception on mobile( as phone in room an ornament ) on second night of stay to say"" you just had dinner with us and didn't pay or leave a card at reception to charge it to"" informed her i most certainly did pay and had receipt to prove it. "" oh ok, whatever"". no apology forth coming and had to insist on one. i am willing to make allowances for hotels just reopening but there is no excuse for rudeness and being unprofessional. the bar and restaurant in hotel quiet compact and very concerned about the number of people and how long they stayed in these areas. we just had drinks with dinner and left. most had drinks before and stayed well after ( as observed when coming down from room to bring drinks up from bar)."|1.0|2021-06-06 02:00:00

the ambiance on the rooftop is great! beautiful views, with fire pits available if you're feeling a little chilly. we were late meeting our reservation, but were still seated right away which was nice. our waiter, augustine, was very friendly, however, he would be mia for long periods at a time. i try to be understanding of that, because i know many places are suffering from worker shortages in this postintra-covid world we live in. i was a bit disappointed that i had specified in our reservation that we were there to celebrate a birthday, but at no point during our dining experience did anyone on staff acknowledge or inquire about that. my biggest source of discontent was with regard to the menu. i am vegan, and ordered the chilaquiles (hold the sour cream) only for my meal to arrive smothered in cheese. please note that cheese is not listed as an ingredient in the item description. so i sent it back and requested it be replaced with the beyond burger, which i waited hungrily for while the remainder of my party ate. when the beyond burger came, it appeared to have a creamy sauce, but i just ate it any way, as i had already waited too long. i think the staff could benefit from some basic education on veganism (that holds true for a lot of establishments), so that they know when to disclose information about certain dishes which may be mistaken as vegan at first glance. aside from that, and slow service at times, it wasn't a bad experience. and the drinks were great! def my favorite part.|3.0|2021-12-09 18:52:00

nothing to hotel was absolutely packed out the restaurant, people drinking and kids running around. a child ran into my babies buggy. kids running up and down the corridor till 12:30 at night, screaming. could hear people outside in the playground too. staff didn't wear mask at reception, when we got down to our room we noticed it was an interconnecting room onto 2 other rooms, we asked could they be locked from our room as one is a different numbered room and with it been so busy and full of people drinking, thought, or last minute booking, we wanted the door locked and a member of staff came down and sighed when he was locking the door, like we were bothering him. the food is horrible i had a chicken curry and tasted dull, my partner got a salad, freezing cold with wrong sauce on it! the room was cold the heat was off when i turned it on, they were turned off anyway. room basic out, was clean enough bath tub.. no! didn't take a shower didn't go for breakfast, first time ever i left a hotel early!! very poor will not be coming back|1.5|2021-10-24 02:00:00

"we made a reservation through open table for 2:30pm for thanksgiving day dinner. we were seated about an hour after our reservation time. we were fine with waiting, it was a holiday, several diners decided to overstay their allotted dining time of 1.5-2 hours.
it is unfortunate that customers overstay their allotted time to dine. it's great that you want to enjoy time with your family or friends, but, it's thanksgiving day. there are other customers waiting. if you need more time, get up and go into the bar area or rent a room at the restaurant. it's common sense and common courtesy.
i took off 1 star for the service in the bar before dinner. the bartender was overwhelmed. i don't have an issue with someone unable to handle the work load. i have an issue with the managements inability to recognize what is happening and send in someone to help the bartender cleanup, restock, etc. while the bartender waits in customers.
the view was amazing!! the restaurant is on the second floor, with the entry and bar on the first level. the view is just over the tops of the trees and looking onto the crescent rose hotel.
the food was excellent!! we ordered the traditional turkey dinner. the dallas cowboys game started during our dinner, so i leaned my iphone against a flower vase and we watched the game without sound. it was actually really fun and kind of cool!!"|4.0|2021-12-12 16:54:00

the restaurant's ambience reminds of the metropole hotel in hanoi, very beautiful and authentically colonial vietnamese. we especially love the second floor. the food is lovely and there is a nice wine list. the service on this visit was not as good as our visit two weeks ago. the server relied on the support staff to do most everything and was not keeping up with our needs. we don't feel that this service model works and hope it's not a new development at a restaurant that we otherwise love.|4.0|2021-10-23 16:32:00

we first were at the lounge area where the host got us a table with no heater. the waitress at the lounge area was even harder to get hold of. the overall experience was just bad due to bad service. very disappointing!"|3.0|2021-09-15 04:33:00

"the tavern at the sun inn is a wonderful venue for a casual (and delicious) meal.
the setting is delightful, and the staff are most attentive and helpful.
the menu items are wonderfully presented, with many appealing choices. the lobster roll was excellent, as was the adams salad. the many beer and wine choices are not overpriced.
the only negative is that the noise level is high. this is undoubtedly due to the many hard surfaces present in this old inn. (i am not sure what, if anything, can be done to mitigate the noise level).
overall, a wonderful and engaging dining experience. we will return."|4.0|2021-11-29 23:23:00

enjoyed our time at the rooftop, doesn't matter if you book the experience or not, it's basically available every weekend. the host didn't even bother to ask and gave us bother. i think we got lucky as we were seated in the shaded area but since the current older server who was super grumpy was not attentive and didn't even bother to acknowledge us, we asked the host and he sent us another server with a pink shirt who was pretty amazing. if it wasn't for that delay i'd suppose our experience there would of been totally different. food was good and drinks were excellent . overall we were satisfied.|3.0|2021-09-19 23:55:00

the food was excellent and the staff was very friendly and helpful. we were seated right away upon arriving however the restaurant was very busy and filled. to this point it took almost 15 mins before our waitress appeared and took our drink order. the only other issue was i was served the wrong soup. after about 7 mins or so i had to go and locate our waitress because she was no where to be found and report the error. she immediately took care of the error and had the correct soup out to me within minutes. again all our entrees were prepared well and tasted wonderful, no question with the food. the two issues may be attributed to new staffing and being very busy. we will certainly visit the inn again!|4.0|2022-01-23 15:05:00

bed was big and extremely comfy, spotless sheets, lovely soft duvet and pillows. bedside locker had a double socket plug, and another beside the wardrobe area. bathroom was perfectly clean, we were provided with ample towels and bottles of hair and body wash and soap. plenty of storage and hangers, we were even given some tea and mini kettle for a cuppa in the morning. the room is above a nightclub so there was definitely a bit of noise but this was muffled and to us, was not obtrusive. staff were extremely professional, polite and very friendly, great to chat to and very helpful. the hotel is secure, we came back late from a concert and all we had to do was say it to the doorman of the club and they opened the hotel doors for us to come in. we would be very happy to stay here again, it was perfect for our needs and literally a 5min walk from stephen's green and the luas for ultimate convenience. some minor cosmetic updates could be useful (eg there were some patches of white paint over the room's purple, which were obviously just a quick patch job) the bath had several small chips in it but this is only cosmetic and does not affect functionality. the room was definitely a bit smaller than portrayed in the images but not a deal breaker.|4.5|2022-05-25 02:00:00

the food was wonderful--our waiter couldn't have been more delightful and accommodating. only the noise level was a distraction--found ourselves shouting to be heard--especially difficult for someone with hearing difficulties. for a starter we shared the cauliflower starter. then, moving on 3 of the entrees were tried and all were pronounced great; chicken and waffles, gnocchi, fishcakes. would i go there again? in a heartbeat!|5.0|2021-09-02 13:35:00

i think, in fairness, the mitre has had a few teething problems with their re-opening. i went on the first day of reopening and we had a very cold table and it lacked atmosphere and the staff were a little forgetful with our order and then they ran out of food as they had forgotten to bring all our starters..so, not very efficient. last week we came again and had a better experience, except for with the wines. the first wine we ordered they had run out of, the next one they brought was 5 years older and so we chose another wine and there was only one of those with the same vintage! considering the good publicity it received in the summer last year, they will need to up their game.|2.0|2021-04-26 16:46:00

"perfect location.
front line staff, hostess and waitress, pleasant and professionsal. service was practically pre-pandemic.
gentleman working omelet station appeared to be distracted and needs an assistant. i ordered mushroom and spinach with swiss, and after all of us who began as strangers ended up trading omelets, i was left with mushroom and enough cheddar to completely obscure the fact that there was an egg in there somewhere.
no sense to ask for a redo at that point as their was no reason to believe a second order be any more successful than the first.
go there quite often, and assume this was an abberation. would still highly recommend."|3.0|2021-10-05 02:37:00

nice location, surprising this close to a major airport. nice historic building with stately interior. even nicer staff who were forthcoming to accommodate our wishes. very good breakfast (all of us tried three different warm breakfasts on our three mornings and all were good). my room was rather cold when i arrived. that was because the last guest turned the radiators down, and the markings on the thermostats were hard to recognise. however, the host turned the heating on when requested and i found the correct position of the thermostats.|4.5|2022-07-01 02:00:00

upscale restaurant at san antonio and mlk intersection. complementary valet parking. entry through a plush lobby of otis hotel. restaurant is well appointed. attendants are formally dressed. tables are well spaced and chairs are comfortable. full service bar on one side and kitchen on the other. clean table, silverware, water and wine glasses with proper dinner napkins. we ordered paloma - it was mixed well. we had shrimp cocktail and tuna wonton taco's for starter. for entre cilantro seared halibut garnished with heirloom tomato, lemon, fennel, sweet pepper. roasted asparagus on the side. bread pudding for dessert. every dish was outstanding. we had great time. would definitely recommend it. just to be aware: potions are fashionably tiny as in so many upscale restaurants. it can be quite expensive - budget before opening the bottle. it would help if staff would have brought up and suggest pairing. management would do well by training staff not to offer the least appealing table to clients of color.|5.0|2021-11-14 00:51:00

we ate at ocean hai last night and i want to share some feedback. i understand the service issue we are facing so i can work past the slow service - we would not see darryl for long periods of time. what am disappointed in is the fact that we told him my wife has a shellfish allergy and he said he would make sure the food was prepared separately - we ordered 4 sushi rolls with 2 with shellfish and 2 without. a) all 4 served on the same tray with the 2 without shellfish being on the ends and b) the rolls were touching one another. we did our best to make sure she ate only the pieces not touching but unfortunately that did not work as she became sick shortly after dinner. that leads me to believe either our server did not communicate the shellfish allergy or whoever prepared the rolls doesn't understand what a shellfish allergy is. either way - your staff can use some coaching up.|4.0|2021-12-26 00:56:00

the shrimp scampi with gnocchi has the sauce that was wayy to salty and then the creme brulee filled donut was sprinkled with way too much salt on top.

it's a perfectly fine restaurant inside a marriott hotel. to be honest not what we're expecting (re: restaurant inside the marriott) but perhaps i should have paid more attention. really nice food, really excellent service, lots of locals, lots of dogs (we sat outside). perfect if you're looking for low key night out or delicious food - not quite the marina del ray experience i was expecting but great nevertheless.|4.0|2021-12-09 06:34:00
this hotel isn't set in the most ideal setting but it has so much to offer. it is clean, welcoming and very comfortable. i literally cannot fault it. wonderful bar food and breakfast and extremely professional and friendly staff. in todays crazy hotel price blitz it was great value. nothing we didn't like in fact we were very pleasantly surprised.|5.0|2022-07-03 02:00:00
"the building was nice, interesting that you can walk about and have opportunities for interesting pictures and stuff.
food tasted nice, but it was just too little portions. the menu could benefit from being bigger and also giving the options of bigger portion sizes- the price for the steak for just getting a steak was poor. you could get a steak with the extras you would usually expect to be there for the same price somewhere else, and the peppercorn sauce was really salty.
the service wasn't ideal. we were asked what we would like to drink (both says strawberry daiquiris) and offered table water. 15 mins went past and still no table water. we were then informed 5 minutes after our initial wait for drinks that there wasn't any strawberry daiquiris available; and this is at 20 to 7 on a friday night.. again that's not great. we had finished our meals by the time any form of drink had arrived at our table.
we got our final bill, and we weren't made aware that it was 50% off on all food. this was a nice and welcome surprise, but had we have known that in advance, we probably would have ordered more food and thus not had to get something back at the hotel later on."|2.0|2022-01-22 13:05:00

"first off the food is amazing. no issues there, menu well explained by staff and came in good time.
however this restaurant lets itself down badly with seating. i booked online and asked for the best available table, when we got there we were sat in a thoroughfare room off the main restaurant. the seats were soft so it was like i was sitting on the floor and we were up against a solid wall to my immediate right which turned out to be the kitchen.
with spaces throughout we identified another table and asked to sit there. this had to be checked. then is was deemed permissible!
we were still however in an area where the hotel guest came and went as this restaurant is within a hotel complex. we saw guests in robes walking by from the spa, a group of golfers with clubs walked past our table to return to their room and various other comings and goings. when they have a specific restaurant with empty tables this was all unnecessary and a bit weird!
we didnt get their best available table and my advice when booking here is to specify you want to eat in the restaurant, not the foyer area. the food was exceptional though but the wine extremely pricey even for faux edinburgh prices (9.10) for a small malborough sb for example is extortionate.
we would eat there again but only if i was certain we would be in the main restaurant area."|2.0|2021-09-12 22:22:00
my only fault was i went down to reception to the man that was working that night and asked if he could fill are kettle up with tap water for a cup of tea , he was refusing and telling me to use the bathroom water , i know it's probably okay to use it , but i was always told use downstairs water , he was near enough next to the tap and after nearly 10 mins of explaining i'd be happier using that water he filled the kettle and told us next time use the bathroom water , just through he was quite rude about it , as it takes less than a minute to fill a kettle with water ! all other staff was so polite and would go out there way to help you . friendly welcome from the young man on the desk when arriving , fast and easy check in , rooms where a good size and very clean , loved the shower , it was quite big so loads of room ! the breakfast was good value and friendly staff serving which where all very helpful . stayed in march 2021|4.5|2021-03-31 01:00:00

"traditionally a gauchos's man, however wanted a change, while enjoying a few days in london with the wife. lots of walking during the day and under orders from the wife to ""book something within walking distance of the hotel"" (hilton tower hill) i had a quick search for steak restaurants nearby. blacklock was one of many in the area, however a 7 minute walk from the hotel sealed it. a short walk later we arrived after walking passed accidentally. the view i was expecting from street level was a busy steak house, bank holiday saturday and all that, however there was nothing to pier in at. through the front door and down a short flight of stairs revealed a fabulous and full steak house. the greeting was amazing and quickly taken to our table even though we arrived 30 minutes early. attention to detail and our needs were looked after fabulously, the menu was full of great drinks and delicious food. we had six cocktails two amazing rump fillet cooked to perfection. beers, sauces and espresso martinis to complete the evening. the manager polished off an incredible evening with a complimentary blacklock twist on the espresso martinis. superb. the bill - only 68. yep incredible. although we are tourists when in london again we will absolutely return i hope many time."|5.0|2021-08-29 14:15:00

pros: as an sdr you are enabled to be the best. when you start the company flies you out and puts you up in a hotel (great opportunity to use the platform and see it's benefits) at hq in palo alto for a sales/tripactions bootcamp. when you come back the learning doesn't stop. your manager, team and anyone in the business is there to provide feedback and support wherever you need it. i leveraged this feedback, was successful and was promoted to manager in 12 months. as a manager, i'm meeting with directors and vps regularly on strategy to improve the team. in addition, i hire for my own team and work with my reps to get them promoted as soon as possible. tripactions operates in and is disrupting a $12 trillion industry. as the company continues to grow and gain market share, your opportunity to grow within the business increases as well. cons:the team is always thinking strategically about how we can improve, leading to a lot of change which can be a little stressful. having said that, i rather work for a company looking for ways to be better and deal with the change versus a stagnant business. keep doing what you're doing.|5.0|2022-11-22 20:31:00

for me it is close to family so that's why i stay in the hotel it is beyond dated. i struggle to believe this is a 4 star hotel, it doesn't even have air con in the rooms. the hotel needs a complete face lift. the area by the restaurant always smells|1.5|2022-12-20 01:00:00

the view was fabulous, our room was large and comfortable. short walk into cobh..restraunt in the hotel was ok, not to much choose from..but the food was ok..the hotel its self is small, 19 rooms , so not overcrowded, maybe a little over priced, but if you get a room with a view it's worth every penny..if you are looking for a relaxing break this is definitely the place to go, especially if you get the large rooms at the front looking over the sea..was stunning.. nothing|5.0|2021-09-25 02:00:00
staff were friendly. location was lovely albeit dunlaoighre town appeared deserted and even local grocery stores closed early. i realise a lot of that is outside of the control of hotel owners but i have to admit it was a disappointing stay-cation. the bed was super comfortable with great pillows and the grounds of the hotel are nice. obviously due to covid restrictions, facilities were limited, no change of towels or stock up of coffeemilk occurred which was disappointing. the hotel, while clean, appeared a bit neglected and in need of upgrading. would be nice if cocktails were included on the drinks menu in the residents lounge as we don't drink heavy alcohol, wine or beers. i had hoped for beauty treatments but the spa were unable to fit both of us in despite 2 days notice and were fully closed on one of the days we stayed there so that was a non-starter.|3.0|2021-07-08 02:00:00

stumbled across this place on open table, coming from far away berks country where we live. very glad we went for my mom's birthday. took daughter from hershey med school and we had a lovely evening. service was very slow (busy saturday night after valentine's day) but super nice. the owner came over to chat with us and made us feel like welcome new neighbors even though we drove 1.5 hrs to be there. the food took quite a while as well but was very good. menu has high end steaks and seafood and everything was delis delicious! staff were all very friendly. it was a bit pricey but well worth it. would definitely return.|4.0|2022-02-20 14:03:00

the food was okay, although the menu is very limited. food came out quickly, but the bar is a different story. minimum 20 minutes for any drink order, even with 3 or 4 tenders manning the bar. the table next to us ordered iced tea and lemonade and waited 25 minutes. we ordered mixed drinks and waited a little longer. the restaurant was full, but it is a very small location so the bar should have had no trouble keeping up with the orders. they've only been open a week or two so hopefully they will improve with time.|3.0|2021-10-24 22:45:00

fine dining is nowhere to find in coquitlam so many thanks to the wild fig. i loved every minute of it. the service is impeccable and warm hearted. the bar is simply beautiful. to start, me and my wife, both big james bond fan, ordered two vesper martini which turned out to be glorious and the ultimate beginning of what i like to call a class a evening ..a bit later, hungry, we asked to be seated. i ordered a ribeye steak and i was right to do so wow! ..beautiful! my wife, a food connoisseur, ordered the lamb shank witch turned out to be a succulent revelation and an eventual next choice for my next visit here. in the end, this place is far from anything else i've experienced when it comes to good food, good martinis( finally) and good servicethx, i will be back.|5.0|2021-12-16 21:32:00

stayed here as an essential worker for one night and have to say i cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. from the moment we arrived we were welcomed warmly by the reception staff and were delighted to find we had been upgraded as we are a newly engaged couple. the room was outstanding with top of the range decor and a gorgeous huge bath. even the tv in the room was bigger than any hotel i have ever stayed in. this hotel has been renovated impeccably. the food in the restaurant is excellent. we had the best dessert of coconut ice cream that we have ever tasted. we will definitely be back! would recommend without hesitation. stayed in january 2021|5.0|2021-01-31 06:00:00

it pains me to write this review as puesto has always been one of our go to restaurants when visiting family in san diego. the food is always excellent but in this last visit the service was inexcusably bad. we were a party of 8, and one of us never received their entree despite asking the server to check on the order and being told it would be coming momentarily. finally after everyone was finished eating we asked that the order be canceled. our server offered to bring it out but with 4 children in our group, we needed to leave. the kitchen clearly failed, but our server was also not on top of them to make sure the entree was being prepared. the server offered to box the order but we had no interest in taking a cold entree back to our hotel room. the entire experience was very disappointing.|4.0|2021-10-11 09:03:00

"i miss the quiet ambience of the former comus inn, and the guarantee of a wonderful view. under the new management and menu, the place is entirely different. it's clearly popular and the food is good. the beer selection is not as large as at other similar places but it's well chosen. i do find some of the portions to be excessive, such as the blt which is over 12 inches long; there should be an option for ""regular"" and ""large,"" to avoid wastage. i also don't think serving potato chips in bags a good idea, bagged chips detract from the quality of the other items on the menu. many other similar places (such as the stained glass pub) offer homemade chips, why can't the comus inn? the little bakery is a nice touch, too."|4.0|2021-11-07 14:08:00

"this was our first time, having heard that the menu is for ""foodies"", and we were not disappointed! walked over from the tropicana, and were seated in a dining room with a lovely fireplace. this was the only negative, because there are only curtains separating this dining room from the bank of hotel elevators, and the noise level was sometimes prohibitive to normal conversation.
our party of six tried a variety of things from the menu, and every bite was impeccable. cheese-curd appetizer, calamari appetizer, our salads, the rolls (we're picky about our bread in atlantic county, and this bread was perfect), and our entrees.. all delicious.
our server fabio was professional and charming, and we followed his recommendations gladly. cocktails were excellent, and the wine by the glass is a generous pour of a fine selection.

the food is just ok. my fish tacos were undercooked and the charcuterie plate was one of the worst looking i've ever seen. chocolate chip cookies were burnt. the service was ok - they work hard to upsell you on bottles and drinks, which is annoying, especially when dining with non-drinkers. tables weren't 100 clean when we sat down. greet staff are just ok. this is a typical hotel capitalizing on the rooftop with sub-par drinks and food. and they don't serve coffee? how can a restaurant serve dinner and no coffee?!?!?!|2.0|2021-07-04 20:45:00

cohen's retreat was the perfect place to both lodge and dine on our way to florida. the cottage truly was a retreat for the two of us and the food was delicious. the halibut with pesto over risotto was mild, fresh and seasoned perfectly. my husband's shrimp and grits was creamy and full of flavor. after dinner we took a little tour of the building and learned the special history of cohen's retreat, all while enjoying the eclectic decor. i highly recommend cohen's retreat for an experience different from your usual dining.|5.0|2021-09-20 06:30:00

"contact details for track and trace were taken on arrival. temperatures taken too.
lots of outdoor tables well spaced. most are away from heaters and lighting sources. not possible to specifically book a heated table. staff were mostly wearing masks and care was taken to not overhandle items coming to the table. drinks, cutlery and meals arrived on a tray which we were asked to take from tray and place on table. menu range is limited - i guess to accommodate social distancing in the kitchen. i thought that the prices were a little on the high side. one way system in the building for toilets was confusing and people were largely ignoring signs. can't imagine eating outdoors here in the evening. our climate is just not favourable enough. lunchtime with a drop of sun was just about comfortable."|2.0|2021-04-15 14:02:00

went for a casual saturday evening dinner with wife and visiting in-laws. the place has been recently renovated and has an attractive outside seating arrangement and the internal seating is also well laid out. tables have been spaced out post covid. the ala carte menu carries a very good selection of starters and mains and the wine selection is great. the place is now managed by experienced staff who have been brought in from a central london hotel and it's definitely an improvement from what we saw 5 years ago when we last visited. suresh the maitre de was super friendly. overall a great experience. recommend the lobster linguine.|4.0|2021-09-26 01:57:00

breakfast, speaking to the manager - he was very understanding and compliant. spaleisure facilities (which we let the hotel know in prior to arrival that we were looking forward to) were closed. the only heads up on this was in the confirmation email in a small print bullet point. i understand that they were closed due to covid however, two staff members read the email i sent, confirmed the pool times and somehow forgot to mention that they didn't have a gym (which i tried to book) and the spa leisure facilities were closed. we spoke to the manager, who was fully compliant and did receive a partial refund upon checking out which went efficiantly. however, we spent almost 30 euros each on a steak in the bar (bill came to over 60euros for one cocktail and two steaks) and the service was incomprehendable. it was like being thrown in a corner and forgotten about. the staff member who took our orders after sitting there for 20 mins barely spoke. we got our steaks, mine without a steak knife, and we didn't receive one curtesy check. after finishing out meal, mine with no steak knife, we sat there for another 20 minutes with clean plates ( steak was tasty )yet no one cleared our table or asked us how our meal was. eventually we just had to get up and walk over to the counter where we asked to charge our meal to the room and still we weren't asked how our meal was. dissapointing stay overall.|2.5|2021-06-17 02:00:00

the menu is somewhat limited with no specials. we had dinner reservations for 8 pm and were told that 3 items were already unavailable. it took some time for the food to be served. i will say my children both had the chicken and liked it very much. i had the mushroom risotto which was good and my girlfriend had the lobster ravioli. she was disappointed because she said there wasn't much lobster in the ravioli and it reminded her of something she used to get from trader joe's. the old inn provides a nice ambiance.|3.0|2021-06-21 05:33:00

breakfast. the bar which was also where you eat was packed with people (in fairness there was an international rugby match on tv). on checking in my name was not on their system. admittedly i was 2 hours later than the time i had indicated for check in ( due to a mishap on the motorway) i was given the last room available (according to the receptionist) who added that bookings.com often did not register on their system. be that as it may i got a communication from the hotel via bookings.com confirming my request for a car parking space so there was some communication. the room was small with the bed taking up most of the space. however the reason i choose that hotel was its location within my very limited walking distance from the gaelic athletic grounds. i enjoyed the match but not the rising incline back to the hotel.that of course is due to the topography and is not of the hotel's making.|2.5|2022-03-08 01:00:00

"wayfarer rooftop 10-course brunch was horrible!! everyone in the restaurant was complaining. it was supposed to be a family brunch to celebrate my daughter's 21st birthday but we waited 45 minutes for our reservation. then we were put in the sun instead of the table we reserved. and the service was so awful it was unbelievable. i told the waiter i had a fatal allergy to nuts and he empathized saying he has the same allergy but my food came out with nuts. they brought my husband the complete wrong food and by the time they brought his food the other five of us were all done. they didn't bring water to the tables and guests were going to the bar to get their own. my daughter had to go to the bar to order drinks since our waiter never came by. they took our silverware between courses but didn't bring new silverware. and the 10-course fix-price menu comes with a final round of frozen wine drinks that never came. after waiting another 30 minutes we just left. we asked for a to-go box for the dessert but the waiter never brought the box so we left it. do not go. it will ruin your special occasion. i have never been so disappointed by a restaurant on a special occasion and am so sad for my daughter.
update: josh, the director of food & beverage, called me and was very apologetic and empathetic. i appreciate his professionalism and the steps he took to remedy the situation. hopefully with someone like him at the helm, this place will improve dramatically."|1.0|2021-09-23 06:50:00

had been driving past the filly on a regular basis going to and from lymington via various routes and wondered why it had been so loong since it had started the much needed refurb. apparently the delay was caused by a spring on the grounds and covid. so now it was reopened i thought we should give it a try. in general we found the experience a very please one with lovely staff and generally good service. desserts took a long time to arrive but it was obvious that, like so many places, they were short staffed. the food was excellent and we can thoroughly recommend both the lamb shank and the pork belly. desserts were very nice but the crumble was too large and needed more custard. it was however, very tasty. two gripesthe wine prices are very steep 35 for a bottle of gavi is extracting the michael. it is not even a gavi di gavi. and a pink pino grigio!!. second is the noise level!! very difficult to hear fellow diners on your table. this is a very common problem in modern restaurants. predominately hard floors and hard surfaces everywhere, so nothing to absorb the noise.|3.0|2021-09-20 12:07:00

we had difficulties with the log in for the door. the person who came to help did best she could but her manner was unhelpful in the situation. the owner did come on the phone and was very apologetic and looked after us very well. the apartment is very well designed for a small space but is a very small space so not sure i'd stay longer than 2 nights, but ideal for a weekend break. very well designed, tastefully decorated, well kitted out with everything needed, beds very comfie, outdoor area was amazing as weather was so good, very convenient location right beside bike hire, spar for basic provisions and coffee shop for fab breakfast stayed in june 2021|4.0|2021-06-14 01:00:00

the staff were very helpful and pleasant. the rooms were very clean. the tiles on the bathroom floor were very slippery when wet. i'm on crutches or a wheelchair. the shower curtain was too short, so the water sprayed as far as the doortoilet. it was very dangerous for me or anyone else with disabilities. the tv was on the wrong side of the room and not enough channels. no disabled parking.|3.5|2021-08-19 02:00:00

very disappointed. ate breakfast there the day before, excellent service and meal. on this occasion waited 10 minutes before being approached, 5 minutes longer for coffee. breakfast came, no toast, asked server for toast, nothing came. ate most of meal, cold toast came when finished, waited 25 minutes for bill. not the experience i would expect as a guest of the very fine hotel.|1.0|2021-11-28 20:30:00

"it was our second time going within two weeks and this time the service was way off, my wife's order was not placed and when waitress delivered the other three meals we thought hers would be coming in a minute. about 10 minutes later the waitress came by and told us my wife's order for barramundi was not entered even through we had ordered all 4 meals at the same time. her meal came about 25 minutes after ours and the waitress seemed to dessert our table and was not to be seen much again, no water refills or asking us how things were, perhaps she was embarrassed for messing up her meal? but that is certainly not the way to handle it. we had to ask a busboy to get our check.
the location and food was great but the service really lacked which isn't what you would expect from a jw marriott."|2.0|2022-02-12 14:20:00

we've dined here many times on our own and with family and are regulars for breakfast too but this time i have to say the food was very disappointing, the fish and chips batter was thick and stodgy and we always order the whitebait which used to come in a silver cup with grease proof paper, then it came on a plate with the dip on the side then yesterday it came on top of the dip sauce which was awful leaving the whitebait soggy, the dish size and quality is not consistent. the staff and service is always very good so we will give it another go.|3.0|2022-01-01 11:58:00
the breakfast was lovely in particular a lovely staff member was so helpful when i woke late on the first morning and made sure i got something. we got and paid for a late checkout and we were hassled constantly after 12. we had 4 knocks to the door from people looking to clean the room and 3 phone calls from reception asking why were we still there. having to explain to each person we had a late checkout each time was exhausting. the car park is hazardous. when leaving i mounted an unmarked island that is invisible from the car and sustained a puncture. i had to have my tire replaced and honestly the hotel couldn't have cared less when i told them.|2.0|2022-11-09 01:00:00

overall was a pleasant surprise. restaurant is in an old art deco hotel so was a bit concerned and entry chairscouches had seen better days. music (dj) was blasting so thought we were at the wrong place. the place was hopping. we were seated outside by the pool which was a bit odd, in very low chairs and a matching height table. not ideal for eating but worked out ok, but would be a challenge for older rickety people to get up. but the food was very good to excellent and the service was outstanding. very creative dishes (eg, the seared avocado's is a must) and all the fish was extremely fresh. a bit on the pricey side but it's south beach so it was to be expected. worth a visit.|4.0|2021-12-14 20:50:00

i am so disappointed about our dining experience at the terrace. it was my friends 50th birthday party, i called ahead before i booked a few months ago to make sure we would get a good spot, however we were so sad to be put on the lower terrace at 19:15, on picnic tables, amongst all diners who were finishing up ready to go. within 30 mins the terrace was nearly empty which made it soul less. i had already asked immediately upon arrival to be seated on the actual bustling and busy terrace where there were 2 tables for 6 free at the time only to be told that there was no availability to move. this was a special occasion and i booked months ahead. it just went from bad to worse from then, with food being late and rose glasses filled just that little too full to make sure we would order an other bottle. we then complained again and ask to move which was now possible! so seated at the terrace where the whispering angel bar is we then had our meal, this is obviously where we should have been seated immediately on arrival. the actual food was delicious when it finally arrived though. and we were offered to not pay for the 2 sharing snacks we had at about 17. a hefty bill later, about 470 for 6 people, we left unsatisfied and a bit sad as we had planned this evening for a long time.|2.0|2021-09-04 11:20:00

superb food and delightful service, although coffee service was slow & coffee was cool when it arrived - and immediately replaced when we mentioned it: full marks for that. conservatory was cold - on a v cold day. but excellence of all the food courses outweighed that. the brill was perfect, the steak beyond perfect, the first course (mark's 3) and puds unusual and pleasing. not pretentious, good sized portions, chairs comfortable. not expensive for this standard, although not cheap either. this is a real pub combined with a non-pub style menu of dishes designed, cooked and presented with flair.|4.0|2022-01-14 13:54:00

"noticeable staffing issues which contributed to long wait times. staff seemed to be new and was not always knowledgeable of basic protocol and procedural information such as menus available for ordering and how to even place an order while in the lounge. the atmosphere was nice. however, more training and improved communication needed for a better overall experience. was also not checked in by hostess so received a nasty gram from open table for no showing the reservation which i had to dispute.
81321 update to the original review
i was contacted by mico and told that i did not check in with the hostess which is why i was no showed. this is not accurate. i checked in at the hostess stand and was greeted. because of my reservation time the hostess went to check with the manager on if we would need to be seated in the lounge or dinning area. in fact she even brought the manager over to explain the change in seating. it is not my fault that she didn't complete her job and check us in for the reservation and i will not be penalized for her error."|2.0|2021-08-13 15:20:00

girls at reception and throughout were lovely. the hotel was close to shops. food in bar very good. the room was very small plus noisey as bus and train station right next to our room. the duvet on bed did not fit the cover leaving the weight unevenly distributed. we paid more for hotel as we wanted 2 use leisure facilities, however all was unavailable due to pandemic. hotel needs a revamp. very disappointing.|2.5|2021-08-15 02:00:00

"disappointing from start to finish. you cannot park at the hotel. had to park down and across the street at the zoo which is dark and not in the best neighborhood. valet was too busy dropping f bombs with his buddy to assist us and then flippantly told us there's no parking here and we need to go park elsewhere. we almost left as soon as we were seated for that reason and honestly we should have. i would've rather saved the $130 and had dinner at mcdonalds.
sat at our table and service was horrible from start to finish. food is mediocre at best. super small portions. my daughter's steak was mostly fat, my chicken was decent with literally one spoonful of mashed potatoes, that's it. my husband's salad was small and meh. creme brulee was watery and mushy and the worst i've ever had and i've had a lot as it's my favorite dessert. do yourself a favor and save your money, or spend it at another place that's tried and true. this place was overpriced and underwhelming."|1.0|2021-11-22 06:14:00
consistency is a huge problem. the first night we ate there was good. tonight was an unmitigated disaster. i only had cold room service coffee all day but despite being really hungry, i could not eat the food. i ordered linguini with white clams that were so overcooked they were vulcanized. the linguini was so under cooked there were pieces stuck together and raw. just left but because it was my birthday my husband ordered coffee and cake sent to the room. room service showed up with a piece of very dry cake and no coffee. pushed it out in the hall so my dinner is now a $4 bottle of figi water. what is most offensive is that they offer to take it off the bill. no, what i really wanted was a hot dinner.|1.0|2022-01-22 18:02:00

went for valentine's dinner, but on sunday since we assumed it would be less crowded. it was, which worked well for us! they had a few specials running, which looked very nice. we got cocktails (very nicely crafted) and the fried calamari. we both got a seafood pasta dish (salmon lemon caper and the seafood linguini). both dishes were excellent! the roasted mushroom side was ok, nothing super special, but still tasty. it was simply presented on a sideb&b plate and appeared to be mostly button or cremini mushrooms, i was expecting slightly more in variety and i think it would have looked nicer if it was in a dishramekinsmall cast iron pan. it just looked like a scoop of mushrooms on a plate, which compared to the way the other dishes were presented, it was a little lack luster, but still very tasty. we did a duo of gelato for dessert, which was very good and super cute in the tall martini glass. the decor is quite nice and it was just perfect for a nice dinner out, but not too stuffy, i would deem in elegant yet approachable. it was our first time and we were very happy with our experience and look forward to coming back to try the gnocchi and risotto!|5.0|2022-02-16 05:03:00

"if you expect 45-star hotel quality foods & service, this place is not the right one.
it's more like good (but not super good to come back) local restaurant quality. foods are okay but needs to wait tons of time whenever you need to see your server to ask something.
i've been to go oftentimes lots of restaurants in 45-star hotel but to be honest, this was the worst experience i've ever had.
they need more training their employees to serve at restaurant in 45-star hotel.
can't believe i'm at lemerdien hotel now."|2.0|2021-12-11 22:31:00

"the restaurant style decor was cozy, country and it had subtle touches of native american vibes, it was lovely. the location is ok as well but it's definitely congestion getting to and from. the service was good but almost annoyingly so with how much the waitress would check in. instead of refilling a low glass of water she'd ask if i wanted water, she didn't seem be relaxed. lastly the food the prices were outrageous for the amount of food on the plate. i bought the shortrib for 40 and it was a single small beef rib, couldn't have been a lb. the sweet potatoes were undercooked & the flavor overall was chili very southwestern dull. the cornbread wasn't original, just jiffy, the grits were the worst! all i tasted was black pepper and cream, horrid. i added salt and that did nothing, i was so done. lastly though their bread pudding was the star of the show, excellent in every way, especially the cream on the side. their bread pudding was very similar to a much better restaurant in dallas called ""buckies moonshine"". overall it's a great place to get a drink but if you're looking for it out of this world flavors this isn't the place to go to. i would've rather have spent my money at the pecan lodge or nusr et any day of the week."|3.0|2021-12-31 18:10:00

my wife and i went here for tgiving dinner, and ordered the tgiving platter. they didnt bother telling us that they didnt have cranberry sauce until our meal arrived. they tried to substitute half a shot glass of some type of pear sauce, but it was such a small amount i have no idea what they expected up to do with it. the dinner itself was very small, and what there was, wasnt very good. no gravy on the turkey, the stuffing was a soggy mess, and the green beans werent even eddible. they werent even going to ask if we wanted desert, and when we tried to order the pumpkin pie that was on the tgiving menu, they said they didnt have any! they did however have a $104 bill for us. we left disappointed and hungry. they totally ruined our thanksgiving dinner.|1.0|2021-11-26 17:12:00

we were seated in a very cold draft and when asked to be moved we were told it wasn't posib. we were the first guests to arrive and the entire dining room was full of empty tables. when we asked to be seated near a window we were told it wasn't possible. after we received our menus, we were offered a move to another table and seated on a warmer spot near the windows,. it was a somewhat confusing experience.|3.0|2021-11-14 10:20:00

the chef amazing we had the carvery and his jam coconut dessert my husband had to finish was beautiful
the customer service and safety covid rules were all in place
but i have to give top marks to the girls all excellent
now here for the gripe
we went back in the evening for a drink
my husband bought two prosecco we sat outside on a bench to drink as he asked if that was ok they said yes but looked like we were on the wrong bench on the grass bit with views of the sea
this rude rude boy working from the smuggle in told us we could not drink our drinks he wanted the glass back and stood waiting for us to drink quick so he could take it back so much for ambiance
he needs a lesson in finishing school i hate making complaints but he was rude ,asking us feel awful

my experience is more about the porch at the wayne hotel rather than the food. i love dining on the porch! rosalie is probably my least favorite restaurant that has occupied the space. i don't love the menu, and the gluten free options are very limited. that said, the food we had was delicious!! i had the salmon and it was really good -- well prepared and not at all fishy. service was just ok, but i think that is a sign of the times with goodany help being hard to find.|4.0|2021-08-20 19:07:00

only a place good for drinks or meeting up to discuss business as far the environment and ambiance. the quality of the food and service is poor. we both ordered the chicken and it came out with a pool of oil on the plate. me and my partner could both take our plates and fill the water glasses with the amount of oil on our plates. lastly, i made a reservation for this place with details and none of them were followed including my partner's milk protein allergy which they did not take seriously at all. nor did they try to go above and beyond to fix the issues we had with the service we received. my advice again is to only come here for drinks with friends, or business.|1.0|2022-02-14 22:37:00
people on reception were very pleasant & helpful. john in the restaurant was very helpful. breakfast is lovely. views are fabulous car park available cobh train station very close room at front of hotel very noisy. rooms are clean but basic. bed was two single beds pushed together so sheets didn't fit, duvet cover too small for the duvet & wasn't very comfortable. we ate in the restaurant first night, was very disappointing. initially waiter pointed to a table across the room & said you can have that one number x & turned away. got a glass of coke was dead, ordered steak well done waited 40 minutes & it came out with blood still coming out of it & no chips & veg with it. asked for it to be cooked to well done when it came back out (same piece of meat) burned on the outside but still pink inside, accumpliments were all just reheated. when the manager (i think john) realised what happened he was very apologetic & helpful but it was just disappointing that it happened in the beginning.|2.5|2021-08-30 02:00:00

we went for the spooky tea for 2. the bad: for $155 (with tip) the quality of the food does not match its price. if there are modifications to the menu, please let the customers know. my date was looking forward to the macarons you promised and cake cookies that are shaped like macarons were served. he was happy about the complementary champagne because we had to wait a while to be served. we did have reservations. the good: the ambiance is perfect for date night or a special occasion! think upscale bourgeois pig. the sandwich and sweets are enough for 2. we didn't over eat. we were gifted 2 tea samples when we left. for food (and dessert), find a better restaurant. for afternoon tea with the same price tag, check out the huntington garden. what you should know: parking is $18 dollars and no validation. there are other parking structures walking distance (10 min) that are $10. we parked at the parking spot ($10 after 4 pm) but the one for macy's is closer. we don't know the price.|3.0|2021-10-30 18:29:00

pros: while working as a locomotive engineer at bnsf for four years i made somewhere between 105k- 135k working approximately 45 hours per week. this does not include time spent in the hotel away from home. cons:they've restructured the attendance policy in 2022 so conductors and engineers are working closer to 60 hours per week. there's very little time off. the time you go on duty is unpredictable and projections vary wildly. you work weekends, nights, holidays. i would say about 90% of the people i came in contact with (from first level supervisors to conductors and engineers) hated being there. they will tell you there is a lot of room for advancement but there's not. i submitted approximately 50 applications to work as a first line supervisor; i had almost ten years of railroad experience and almost 5 years as an engineer, as well as a bachelors degree in organizational development. they like to hire people who are just out of college because they start out at a lower-based salary. advice to management: give employees more time off and make an effort to improve the lineup projections. promote from within more.|2.0|2022-10-25 18:35:00

"the staff were fantastic, service was second to none. very knowledgeable , ,friendly and accommodating. lovely atmosphere and decor was beautiful.
the food didn't quite live up to expectations and felt it was overpriced.
we ordered four mains of which 2 were fish . sea bass and john dory both of which were very good. there was a halloumi burger and fries which was very good also. then there was the vegetarian wellington , well we could hardly see it on the plate and to call it a mains was very over stated. we should really have sent it back and asked for a mains not a starter!! apparently it was tasty but were very glad they ordered a side of chips.
the wine ordered was excellent and the service was exceptional.
the sweets were on the whole poor. there was a strawberry creame patisserie which was sloppy and the chocolate ganache was very good but it came with a separate hazelnut cake which was not worth putting on the plate. the pineapple dessert was the star of the show.
on the whole would i recommend the candlelight inn? yes as long as you choose wisely. except you can't because you don't know what you're going to get. but if you are going for lovely ambiance a nice afternoon out , give it a go and you might choose well.
i cannot overstate how fantastic the staff are but the food needs work for the prices they charge."|3.0|2021-09-20 20:32:00

"i don't even know where to start on this restaurant. when you arrive at the lobby of the hotel and you need to go upstairs to the rooftop to go to cara cara. i was asked for the reservation and my name and i told the gentleman. and he said to me i can't find it. i said well i made it and i confirmed it because are you sure it's for cara cara. because i know there's another restaurant in the lobby. i said yes i did. he then again asked me that same question and i again said to him yes i know which restaurant it is and i again told him my name. he acted like it was not there he could not find it. eventually he said oh i guess it didn't load and my tablet i found it i need directions to go upstairs already a bad start lol.
we arrive up top .. they acknowledge us beautiful setting gorgeous view as everyone says. take us to a four top which is a picnic table basically. having to sit on a hard bench with no back which doesn't work for me when there are other tables that are not like that that are open. we express our displeasure to the gentleman who took us to our table and he said let me check for you.. comes back and gives us a very good table okay all good.. sit for 10 minutes finally someone comes up and asks us if we want drinks we order drinks. 20 minutes goes by and we still do not have our three simple cocktails and it's not 100% full.. when the drinks finally come we're so desperate we actually asked the person who brings the drinks who is not our waiter if we can order food from him and we do such. we only order starters which i guess was a mistake we should have ordered everything from him. anyway the food comes. but again our waiter never came anywhere near the table to ask anything if we were happy or even to order food.. when the runner who brings the appetizers comes by we order food from him. anyway. the food was tasty very expensive as one would expect at a view restaurant on a rooftop situation that isn't the problem. the service was so atrocious that."|2.0|2021-11-30 10:34:00
"what a disappointment. i ordered the american wagyu 8oz filet & pan seared queen scallop (market price as of 91821: $145..you've been warned). i ordered the steak medium rare but it arrived cooked medium well, at best. an overcooked steak is always a travesty, but when it happens with this cut of steak at this price the offense is particularly egregious. the scallops were way too salty - i could've (and have) whipped up better in less than 5 minutes at home. for this price you expect your food to arrive perfectly cooked, especially when you could get a comparable meal just down the block at morton's for less than 23 the price. my husband ordered the lamb shank, which was only ok.

the ambience and environment was the best thing about the restaurant. i went for the brunch and everyone at the table has to either for the executive brunch or do a la carte. it isn't the trading brunch you think of. the 10 course brunch is a great idea, i just felt there should have been more options. the best part was the ambience and being in the open on a nice sunny day! the service was mediocre and it felt as though our server did not want to be there. he didn't check on us and when asked about food on the menu we received very little response.|2.0|2021-07-04 21:01:00

"horendous service. the server seemed like he didn't want to take our orders or did he ever come near our table to ask what we needed. we had to flag him down to request our needs and even then, he was unfriendly in providing us with them. i felt embarrassed to bring my friends here. even though the food was okay, the service ruined the atmosphere, and all of us had a silent consensus that we made mistake of coming here when there were other available options.
if the hotel restaurant is providing such embarrassing level of service, the hotel service has to be in the same par unless the hotel and restaurant are managed by separate managements.
definitely will not go through embarrassing myself again in the future by coming here."|1.0|2022-02-15 22:20:00

"i was delighted to find kilcot arms able to do a midday meal on a monday in these challenging times
it enabled me and my wife to meet my sister and brother-in-law pre-xmas to catch up which we live too far apart to do.
we were met by friendly staff and a warm log stove close to our table. we had adequate room for us oldies to get in and out.
that showed that our extra requirements mentioned on the booking ap had been catered for very well indeed. we were shielded from bar noise by a brick wall but access to toilets was easy and there were sanitizers at sensible spots.
food was as good and well presented as we had seen there pre-pandemic
we were able to exchange gifts in the car park and as it was dry and be less cluttered at the table. there was plenty of space in the car park when we arrived and when we left 2 hours later.
our party of 4 was in or near 70yrs. and i am happy to recommend this venue as an excellent out-of-town venue."|5.0|2021-12-16 13:08:00
"we used to come to the globe and enjoy it, this time it was terrible. here's whyannoyedn- no vegan options on the menu at all
- turns out there were vegan options, they weren't on the menu. our friend ordered the vegan soup and was bought out the non vegan option
- we informed the waiter they had served the wrong soup, the waiter accused us of not being able to tell the difference in colour (they bought a grey mushroom soup, we ordered a butternut squash soup)
- when the butternut squash soup arrived it had a dollop of yoghurt in it (not vegan)
- we asked for bread and olive oil for the table - they said they were too busy for this (the restaurant was not full and there were waiting staff doing nothing)
- 2 jaffa cake desserts ordered, they were terrible and looked shop bought
- 20% service charge was added!
all in all we were throughly disappointed"|1.0|2021-12-19 06:54:00
the location was great, nice common area and kitchen. staff were accommodating and they offer a laundry service which was great. only 1 bathroom for the whole floor which was constantly in use, the walls might as well be bed sheets other peoples doors opening and shutting is enough to abruptly wake you and make you think there's an intruder. people seem to congregate in hall ways and staircases which is pretty annoying at 2 am.|3.0|2022-02-27 01:00:00

"second time i go to this restaurant. both times food and ambience was great but the service really impacted our overall experience.
the first time, we asked the server to split the bill and he said they couldn't (two ways), he said we had to do the math and tell them what amount we wanted them to charge each card which i thought was odd.
second time, the server only came to the table to take the order, i had to get up to ask for water aand them to ask for the check.
pork belly brussel sprouts are to die for and i would put up with the service failures to have them again. would still reccomend"|5.0|2022-02-10 03:48:00

"the food was absolutely fantastic! the largest sashimi bowl i've ever had and it was an appetizer! the restaurant was upscale for sure. outside seating available. inside seating is tables or booths. prices are slightly higher than other hotel restaurants in the same area, but the portions are larger (much larger) then the other restaurants.
the downfall of this place is the service. not the waiting time for the food or drinks, but the attitude of the servers. from once we walked in the hostess was blah (not welcoming, sort of like your dam lucky to be here attitude). our waitress was the least friendly of anyone we have come across in maui, i thought we were at a truck stop diner with her demeanor. the only person that was friendly was he server that brought us appetizers.
once our entrees came we were told if we wanted dessert to let her (our waitress) know asap because it takes 15 minutes to make it ""ok sweetie"". like wtf!
so , if you want some really great food!! go here. but expect truck stop service and attitude if you get the same people as we did.

terra tempe is a nice restaurant in downtown tempe based in the westin hotel off 7th street. it was not fun to park as we had to pay $18 for the valet or find a space on the street if we wanted to park close for 4 bucks. i feel this is an impediment to people going to the terra tempe restaurant as it limits parking especially for the dinner service. our waiter was very nice and attentive and the food was very good. noise level was also nice and we had a good time catching up over our meal. the menu is somewhat expensive and i would imagine they lose customers to the parking issues during the dinner hour. i don't know that i would eat here again even though the food and service was very nice. i imagine most of their business comes from hotel guests only.|4.0|2022-03-08 12:02:00

the food was horrible and flavorless. the jackfruit tasted bland, the quail eggs were bland, the alligator empanadas were tiny and you couldn't taste anything, it was filled with a teaspoon of filling- very underwhelming, we also had the duck wings- there is so little meat- one bite and done. the wagyu sliders were decent size but i don't think there was any cheese, it was meat, spring mix and fries, it could be great if it came with something more than ketchup and some noticeable cheese. i was looking forward to the roasted veg hummus- it has potential! its a nice place until the throw a ton of cold veggies all over it, and we got three huge asparagus spears that were the thickness of tree saplings! they need to get better asparagus. the crab cake and arancini risotto balls were good but we also could have been so hungry that it tasted better than anything there! the place settings and menu were beautiful and its a very nice looking restaurant in a beautiful hotel. we even got to watch housekeeping clean the floors with a lint roller while we were dining, she cleaned all around us. i would not recommend aurora at all, to anyone.|1.0|2022-02-15 14:09:00

probably the friendliest hotel i have been in. i believe it comes from the top down. we had a few problems with our room. plug not working, smell in bathroom, needed more cups and pillow etc and they resolved issues promptly. they helped us print travel documents which was a real bonus. xtra pillows in rooms would be nice. more family friendly needed- have a pack to give kids- crayons paper and think about devoting an area for part of the day where kids can hang out. set up some toys, a tent etc. in new york, a hotel offered cookies and refreshments in the morning. great for families and a wine hour at 4pm. great for people to meet other people at the hotel.|4.0|2021-07-20 02:00:00

i was attending a show in brea, and so the restaurant was a convenient stop to eat. however, i would not go back, not because it was terrible. for the price and the overall experience, there are simply better options."|4.0|2021-12-06 14:10:00

we were seated on the patio. we would have preferred to be seated in the dining room where it was decorated for fall, but i think they were trying to have social distancing. our waiter, matthew, was excellent. our food was good, but if they continue to raise their prices, we are going to have to look for a new place to dine.|5.0|2021-10-20 19:02:00

nice setting by the river, decor in restaurant good and the maitre d very welcoming. service mediocre- had to fill up own champagne, didn't take order for ages, huge menus not taken away so had to have them on your laps. food portions small for price.and pepper sauce tasteless. had heard good things but very underwhelmed|2.0|2021-07-30 13:10:00
"food was fantastic..waitress very good but took a long time to be served food after ordering..over 45 minutes to get our main courses..it took over 20 minutes to get our 2 desserts and one of them was ice cream based.
i think they really should pay more attention to the diners in the premises..possibly concentrating on their takeaway side of things too much."|3.0|2021-11-16 00:35:00
we chose outdoor seating but it's downtown la so lots of car noise and panhandlers calling to you for money. i'd choose indoors if i go again. the food was great, except for the plucot upside-down cake which i found too course and dry, though the earl grey ice cream accompaniment was supreme -- they should offer just the ice cream as a dessert option. brussel sprouts were particularly good. we appreciated the (albeit small) selection of non-alcoholic drinks which were well made, as it's sometimes difficult to find nice cocktails without alcohol.|4.0|2021-11-12 14:05:00

comfortable bed, spacious room, quiet, clean, self-check-in was handy and went smoothly. unfortunately the shower didn't get very warm and i couldn't get the heating to work. there was an air con unit that doubled as a heater, but the icon for heating didn't come on. not having staff on-site meant i didn't ask how to fix these problems, because i didn't want to bother the person at the end of the phone line after 9pm. i've stayed at this hotel a couple of times before and not had a problem with the shower, so perhaps it was just this room. i'd stay again, but just hope for a different room!|3.5|2022-11-25 01:00:00

location is perfect for airport access. i mentioned on booking that i would be staying with my new wife before our flight out on honeymoon. despite this we were given a twin room instead of one with a double bed. the guy on the desk at check in appeared extremely new an to his job and was unable to tell on the system that i had paid in advance, asking how i wanted to pay. minor annoyances were loose light fittings and a toilet seat that wouldn't stay up, slamming itself at random moments.|2.5|2021-08-22 02:00:00

the hotel was brilliant location- central and very accessible. some of the staff were very nice- the staff serving breakfast were lovely and some of the cleaning staff also. very small car park and difficult to access- a long hall carrying bags ect from back car park. limited number of spaces available. the receptionist manager at the check in desk was rude, however all the other staff were lovely. the room we were in wasn't very clean, very outdated, the whole bathtub was cracked and shower curtain was something you would avoid at all costs from touching you in the shower. we had a very dated room!! we did notice when walking past another room when the clearers were in that some of the other rooms where much nicer than the twin room we had. carpets very unclean, mattresses not comfortable by any means. not very good value for money- expensive for the standard of room we got. breakfast was included though|1.5|2022-05-22 02:00:00

we were at the comus inn last night to celebrate my brother's birthday. we sat at the table for at least 15 minutes before anyone even showed up. the overall service was fair, as there were long periods of time before we would see our waiter, plus he was not friendly at all. i'm okay with the slower service, as i know help is hard to get, so maybe they were short staffed. my biggest issue was the price of the dinners. if you want to have upscale prices, how about providing, better than paper thin napkins, mismatches plates, and of course no table clothes. most people ordered the salmon, i didn't hear anyone say, this is good, plus that's all that was on the place, no vegetable or starch, oh yes that was extra, $8 for a macaroni and cheese side. are you kidding me this is not even nyc. i would only return to the comus inn for the outdoor dining when the weather gets warmer.|3.0|2022-02-07 03:37:00

the location is fantastic to the aviva and 3 arena. i found the room very cold and not the cleanest. there was quite a lot of damp and black on the walls which didn't help as i'm a bad asthmatic. the mattress on the bed has a big hole in the middle that you more or less fall into. the curtains didn't close properly and a lot of light gets in in the mornings, but upstairs seemed to be a lot nicer, we seem to be in a basement room. i didn't think it was good value for money. the the locality of it was really good.|3.0|2022-11-19 01:00:00

"if you are concerned about covid, do not eat here. there is very little attempt to limited the crowd size or provide for any kind of social distancing, and by virtue of it being a kid-oriented restaurant, people are every which way trying to keep up with their children. we had both dinner and breakfast here - dinner was bad and breakfast was worse as far as the crowd control goes.
in spite of the overall lousy experience, the wait staff was excellent and should all get raises simply for continuing to work in that madhouse."|1.0|2021-12-20 05:48:00

"my appointment was 4pm and i waited almost 8 mins before getting the attention of the waiter which is at the far end of the room. i order the tea and waiting for 10mins to be serve but he mention that the manager inform him its fully sold out and he mention he will check and let me know. therefore i waited another 8 mins without anyone coming before i wanted to leave the manager kathie passby say he will do something for me and 5 more minutes the chocolate tier was serve but the savory only serve 5 mins as change of to non beef item, and scones run out and he mention he will check but 10mins later he did not come back. therefore i left and meet him at the exit and he mention will send to room which he did, but the bill was not left in my room. as i feedback on the bad service he mention will give me a discount, which i rang the butler asking the bill on 20th sep night nobody call me.
on 21st sep i went for my breakfast which i enquiry on my bill yesterday the sweet lady mention will check and finishing my breakfast i check with her again, she mention the manager waive off the charges and i ask how about the $75 dining credit , she offer to offset with the pastry at lobby at 11am.
i went down to lobby order the cake and she look at her email , suddenly saying the manager only offer 20% off my hi tea bill which i was in the midst of settling the cake bill. she apologise saying how about the cake, i say since she packed them i am ok to buy over which she given me a 20% disc.
but overall very disappointed with the service level at le brassie restaurant, but the hotel other services was excellent.
hopefully they improve the service level at the le brassie restaurant and they send the final bill to me soon."|1.0|2021-09-21 04:57:00

this is truly a hidden gem that will not be secret for very much longer. although dalia had a subtle opening about three weeks ago, it's flavors were anything but! the miami spice offering featured a comprehensive and decadent sample of mediterranean cuisine. from delicious homemade hummus and babaganoush, to outstanding grilled octopus and moussaka, the menu did not disappoint. finally, the desserts were delicious and wine-list comprehensive. the staff were incredibly welcoming and eager to show-off the impressive hotel that houses their restaurant. this is a must-try restaurant for miami residents and out-of-towners. we are eager to return and will bring along friends next time. highly recommend!!|5.0|2021-09-14 03:23:00

we made a reservation for 7:15 on opentable and arrived at 7:00. the host said he needs to honor the 7:15 time, which was fine and we waited in the bar. by 7:40, we had to look for someone to ask about our table. we found the manager and he apologized and looked for a table (which was confusing as we had a reservation) he offered us a table next to the open kitchen. we took it as i was starving. it was noisy and i really don't like to sit next to a food prep area. we sat there for about 15 min and no-one came over. my husband was so angry by then, that we got up to leave. the same manager was walking by and we complained. he apologized and i told him i wanted another table. we actually had to sit in the bar area at a table as he said no other tables were available in the main dining room. i don't understand that..why take a reservation?? i would have left but by then i was so hungry i didn't want to take a chance. we were walking as we were staying at the hotel next door. he apologized again and offered us a complimentary cocktail. he mustered up staff and they finally took our order. the only saving grace was that the food was very good. our realtor for the area commented that this has happened to others that she knows and they seem to make a habit of this behavior.|3.0|2021-03-18 16:42:00

we didn't have the best seat but our reservations were late so we didn't mind that. we saw the waiter five minutes after we arrived with water and menu. five minutes later he took our order , came back 10 minutes later he brought her food, next time i saw him is when he dropped off the bill. i would've loved more wine i would've loved dessert i would've loved more attention. they were cleaning tables getting ready for more people instead of taking care of the people there. a real waste of an anniversary dinner, when i go back to the hotel or restaurant.|4.0|2021-09-20 10:25:00

we booked the limanaki fish restaurant to enjoy a wonderful seafood experience for my birthday. given the heat in cyprus, it is surprising that upon request there were no fans available, only at certain locations. as a 5-start hotel, the staff should place greater effort in ensuring the comfort of guests and make certain there are enough outlets for fans. it was extremely hot and we had to sit in discomfort, eventually having to move due to the heat, nearer to the fans. furthermore, we looked forward to trying the crispy fried baby prawns, only to be informed that they were not available. we do not come to a gourmet restaurant specialising in seafood to be told that there are no baby prawns available. the enjoyment of our food was also limited due to a lot of disturbance by cats and children who were feeding and causing further disruption around us. allowing children to feed animals food with utensils and giving them water in glasses that your clients eat and drink from is completely unacceptable, not to mention unhygienic. a staff member should have intervened. overall, it was not the experience we expected to enjoy at an award winning gourmet fish restaurant, and we left unimpressed and disappointed.|3.0|2021-07-02 11:39:00

because of covid regulations at the time our time was limited in the restaurant but that was nothing to do with the gresham itself. the only other thing that we were unhappy with was that since our last visit in january 2020 the location and arrangements for parking have changed..fees the same. would have been nice to know the arrangement prior to arriving as i had to go into the hotel to find out where to park while my husband did laps of the block. we then had to drive to get there..not far but there is one way system in place around there. then had to bring bags back as we couldn't pull up outside at the time..my suggestion would be to put full info on site and that way customers know in advance and can work out their own logistics. we have stayed there several times in the past and this time we brought friends. beautiful hotel, lovely staff, great food and an excellent location. stayed in december 2020|5.0|2021-02-03 06:00:00

free car parking and 30 secs from front door of hotel. check-in smooth, as rooms had been pre-allocated. key cards worked first time, amazing how many times this is not the case. everything in the room in working order. bed was comfy. didn't eat, but stayed in bar for the evening. bar service was prompt, plenty of staff on which was great for table service facility. toilets near to the bar and clean also. bar staff should have cleared the table of empties. group of 10 over 2 tables, so they built up quickly and we were in full view of the bar staff. we had to clear ourselves. not that much hassle, but bar staff should be doing this. whilst cooked breakfast was tasty and promptly served, we had to ask for cutlery, condiments, cup (for coffee pot which had come without one). waiting staff didn't engage with us as customers, would expect a smile and an hello at breakfast. so broadly i thought the service overall was good, but with a little additional effort from staff it could have been that much better, and they should have been a bit more attentive and looked at the table and pre-empted what we were missinglikely to ask for.|3.5|2021-09-06 02:00:00

food wasn't great. we all ordered different items and no one really like what they got. it was edible, but that was about it. it was on par with the quality of a chili's or applebee's. the tables were sticky, we weren't able to be seated outside even though we requested outdoor seating, and it was so loud we couldn't talk to one another. servers were nice and prompt, so no problems with the service. it didn't feel like you were in an upscale hotel since the restaurant was pretty unremarkable and you couldn't see outside so it's not like you pay for the views. so overall, it wasn't worth the drive or the price of the food.|3.0|2021-10-27 21:25:00

i am reluctant to criticize any hotel coming out of lockdown as it has been crucifying difficult for you. just delighted for a night out. great to see you so busy, and realise there are problems recruiting staff etc, so you're feeling your way to full opening. constructive critique: front desk undermanned. 2 people working hard, but with numbers picking up need more. the lovely lady at the temporary desk in reception is imop a great resource at front desk. restaurant staff worked so hard. give them a raise!! hotel decor etc needs a revamp. realise money prob not there now, but you're damned if you don't. overall i would recommend. get out of bed early and walk on the incredible beach within 100 yards of your room. give the hotel industry a break. book local and. we'll all benefit down the line. the location, the staff. stayed in june 2021|3.0|2021-06-27 01:00:00

we had a wonderful date at the bradford house. we showed up early for drinks at the bar. the gin and jam drink is fantastic. we had some friends join us, and they had wine and beer. the prices on the wine are a bit high for what you receive. for appetizers we had the bread and butter and the charcuterie board. the bread appeared to be freshly baked, and it is covered with mushrooms sauteed in butter. it was absolutely one of the most delicious things we ate. the charcuterie board was pretty plain. for dinner we had the steak (amazing flavor) and the duck. the duck entree was two small pieces of duck and a half plate of brussels sprouts. the flavor of all of the food was spot on, but we wished that there was at least one more piece of duck. the price for what we received was a little high, but we do realize this is a boutique hotel. for dessert we had the quincy bake house lemon square and the walnut pie. both were really tasty. we will definitely be back!|4.0|2022-01-30 17:49:00

the overflow room upstairs felt like we were sitting at a hotel breakfast buffet. lights were really bright from the party room, lack of music, the table wasn't set. as a table of two, we felt like we were just being shunted and forgotten about. weird arrangement going on here with the lack of ambiance in their upstairs room.|2.0|2021-11-14 21:34:00

the hotel is located in a lovely square in the centre of the town. there is a lovely private courtyard to the rear where we enjoyed predinner drinks. all the staff were friendly and attentive. the rooms were clean and very smart with different colour schemes in each bedroom. it was lovely to see that another couple were able to bring their dog with them for their stay and the hotel was most accommodating to them. the location is ideal as a base for travelling around the beautiful countryside and beaches. there was also a more intimate feeling to the hotel that larger hotels lack. i would highly recommend this hotel nothing. we really loved it and will visit again|4.5|2021-06-08 02:00:00
"we were so lucky to have picked ula for our thanksgiving meal. we were also fortunate to opt to have our non-traditional meal at 3:00 when the numbers were lighter before the 250 arrived for their big meal. we sat at one of the bar banquets and got the ambience of the jellyfish which are so beautiful. to our amazement, the new owner had only opened the restaurant 7 days earlier (purchasing the farallon). he also owns the restaurant that is across the corner in the donatello and has obviously run it well for 25 years. we predict ula will be a great success, too. although they had a traditional tg meal at a prix fixe price, we were still able to order from the regular menu. my partner had tuna tartare and then lobster ravioli. i had a delicious beet salad with burrata ""topping"" that made it perfect and then the scallops. it was all presented so beautifully and was delectable in every way. the staff, from the owner to victor, the general manager, to the waiter, orlando, to, especially the chef, ryan, made our early dinner delicious and memorable. it was also so convenient to our boutique hotel, king george, which also took the best of care of us. add in the van gogh and sistine chapel exhibits and we had the best of times. thank you to everyone!"|5.0|2021-11-27 14:46:00

what a wonderful restaurant ! we recently went for dinner and looked at each other wondering what took us so long to try it! in the wayne hotel, which is a classic in its own right. we sat at the bar for dinner and had a wonderful time. bar servers were highly knowledgeable about the menu and very enthusiastic about it, helping us with selections. olives and toasted nuts to start - awesome. i had a wonderful pasta dish and my wife loved the buratta- came with plenty of fresh toasted bread. drinks were great as well. all in all, a great evening at a great restaurant!|5.0|2022-05-11 12:18:00
"as members of the national trust we are always looking for new places to visit and as such when the fleece was recommended by friends we decided to visit.
we weren't disappointed.
there was plenty of parking, although i can imagine in the summer their being a shortage of spaces, but that wouldn't stop us visiting again.
this a real old pub and we loved everything about it, from the low ceilings to the uneven floors, and the roaring fire was a real bonus.
the food was good although my partner would have preferred it to be a little hotter.
we will definitely visit again!"|5.0|2022-01-24 04:34:00
the location of the hotel is excellent central to most things surrounded by some lovely restaurants. the welcome was very warm and the servers at breakfast particularly katie and megan were exceptional. the only thing that let this hotel down was the room. whilst is was clean it was particularly basic and without a doubt the smallest hotel room i have ever stayed in. size of room no welcome pack in room|3.5|2022-01-20 01:00:00
the room was clean, spacious and comfortable. the little duck on the towels was a lovely touch and the goodies for a cup of tea, muffins were fab! we had booked dinner on saturday night in the hotel and when we went down to the restaurant we weren't booked in. they fitted us in but there was only 1 vegetarian option, thai vegetable curry so we had to eat elsewhere which didn't leave much choice as we hadn't got a booking.|4.0|2021-11-22 01:00:00

almost everything was good until the bill arrived. it was half price wine night and the bill showed that we had two $250 bottles when in fact it was two $120 bottles. i sent the bill back and it came back still too expensive. i had the impression that this isn't the first time that this happened. i brought it to to the waitress attention and all i received was an apology and no offer to fix it for a third time. sad!|2.0|2022-02-07 18:16:00
nothing that i like. will not go back again i was the guest of room 22, and i complained on the day of check-out. food (dinner) was not up to standard. highly below average compared to all the hotels i stayed at. worker of that night at the till was highly unprofessional. quoted from what she said: ''i will kill them'', referring to her peers. kitchen did not follow 100% haccp on not contaminating meat and veg. hence, those food labelled ''vegetarian'' that you ordered might be cross-contaminated with meat. especially the ''make your own pizza''. food is a big disgrace, the only reason customers are paying is because there is no other option. highly suggest the managers try the menu, and re-evaluate whether you will pay that much for the drowned chicken wings in cheap bbq sauce. and ask someone who is vegetarianvegan whether they like their saladvegetarian food to get contaminated with meat. you are lucky that the person has no meat allergies. please revise the haccp course. i guess there is a reason why other hotels are doing better than yours. the huge size of the shuttle bus of other hotels, which picks up huge numbers of customers from the airport, indeed tells the story. same prices in other hotels, same prices of the dinner in other hotels, but lower quality in this hotel. i will not come back again.|1.0|2021-10-08 02:00:00

"the menu is really poor; there are very few healthy choices.
the service was poor; the waiter didn't ever come around to even ask if my wife wanted a refill on her pepsi. we got the at 4:45 pm when they were not too busy to ask.
the hostess seated two people right next to us (no privacy) when there was ample seating everywhere.
my wife needs handicap parking and there was no available parking any where near the restaurant, because of some sort of asu event at camelback.
a very unpleasant evening at the camelback; we were out of there within an hour of eating a portion of our grease filled meal.
the only item that was good was my martini."|2.0|2021-12-06 22:29:00

the room itself is seperate from the pub and restaurant. so you don't get the usual noise from the bands, or people drinking in the pub late at night. the room itself was very quiet, and very clean. the bed was very comfortable. the shower is a walk in type shower and very spacious. the television has plenty of channels to watch. the seperate and free parking was brilliant! the staff were very pleasant and helpful. the breakfast in the morning was gorgeous and hot. there was supposed to be free wifi access, but the password left on a card in the room didn't work. i tried using my ordinary phone signal in the room to access the internet, but i couldn't. so i had no internet access in the room on my phone, and i had to go outside to use same. i also tried to change the date of the booking to the following week, due to an emergency, but the hotel refused my request.. as most hotels do in ireland! so i showed up anyway, so that they couldn't rent it out to someone else. also the view from my room was blocked by a prefabbuilding located two feet from my window, blocking my view. i also think this prefab was the cause of my lack of phone signal.|4.0|2021-08-07 02:00:00

the room can get a bit cold, and heating could've been better. just remember to bring your warmest pyjama if you're staying there in the winter and you suffer cold. iron is not there, beware. john, the american receptionist, was very kind in welcoming us and also giving us a room upgrade! really nice place where to spend a romantic night after a restaurant date in the city centre. nice bathtub and comfy bed. stayed in december 2020|5.0|2021-01-22 06:00:00

"best brunch ever! service was impeccable, and the meals for our family of four, were outstanding. a little pricey, but for the ambiance, attention to detail, pristine dining area and a different take on some familiar breakfast items (i.e eggs benedict with smoked trout and the best holladnaise sauce ever tried - not the the funky typical orange blob you normally get!) the stunning setting with scenic views of the hudson river and historic abbey inn, plus immaculate yet charming, delightful and cozy dining room made this one of the most memorable brunches ever. the food was divine - they even had ""real"" british plump sausages! presentation of the menu items was so creative, we enjoyed every morsel - clean plates all round! even my 17 year old son complimented by saying best meal ever! definitely will be back, a real treat!"|5.0|2022-01-17 19:41:00

"we had heard good things about the deauville since their new renovation and decided to give them a try today and we are really glad we did! the whole vibe of the place was great. we were greeted immediately when we walked in the door and seated very quickly by the friendly hostess. within seconds our server, kimmie, was welcoming us to the deauville and walking us through the menu process and getting a drink order. she quickly returned with our drinks and told us about some of their signature items and told us to take our time and she would be back. i love this! one of our pet peeves is the bums rush to get you in and out but she definitely wanted us to enjoy our time out. almost like she could sense that we needed it lol. we ordered and our first course and it came out really quickly from an extremely friendly food runner. we both had french onion soup which was done really nicely, we loved the touch of pancetta in the broth. we had plenty of time to enjoy our soup and kimmie checked back on us, refreshed our water, and asked if we needed anything else. our food was delivered a few minutes later. she had the prime rib sandwich and i had the chef's special, the clam bake. both were absolutely spot on! overall it was a really great experience. the ambiance was cool and you could certainly see what it would be like in the summer! we were impressed by the friendliness of the staff, everyone looked like they were happy to be there. i would be remiss if i didn't reiterate how great our server was. she couldn't have been any better than what she was, like having an old friend hanging out with you!
we are certainly going to come back, a really great dining experience in the middle of the pandemic and, having said that, we felt extremely comfortable with the precautions that were in place and how the staff went out of their way to make you feel safe. thanks and we will see you again soon!"|3.0|2021-02-21 03:42:00

had a reservation (you'll need to plan far ahead) for dinner. we were seated next to a loud and over-served group. not necessarily blaming the staff for the guests' poor behavior, but overall, our comfort and experience was greatly affected by that. it happens. the food was well-prepared and thoughtful, albeit at hotel-restaurant prices; the limoncello packed a punch, the wine was divine, and each course was artful and flavorfulthe chicken genovese was especially yummy. the interior is fresh, elegant, and shiny. i wouldn't shy away from going backjust a shame that our dinner wasn't as comfortable as we'd hoped.|3.0|2021-12-08 17:29:00
"we loved our thanksgiving dinner at the deauville. our waiterbartender ryan was wonderful. he makes a stellar martini. this may sound ridiculous but the turkey was the best turkey i have ever eaten - full of flavor and moist. the she crab soup and stuffing were my second favorites. the only bad thing we had to say was that we weren't offered any mashed potatoes with the thanksgiving platter special.
the sunset over the bay was spectacular.
i was very impressed by our meal and the staff especially in light of the fact that we are in off season and with the staff shortages in the world right now the owners and management should be proud of their staff.
kudos to the chefs and staff !!
as i said on our way out - thank you for working so that we could enjoy ourselves on thanksgiving.
my advice for those that have never been - run don't walk to the deauville inn.
ps we typically have been to the inn during the summer months - it was so refreshing to be there in off season and we apologize but the food was so delicious we neglected to take pictures before devouring our drinks dinner and dessert"|4.0|2021-11-26 18:36:00
we decided to try a new restaurant tonight and we chose firelake grill house. this restaurant is located inside of the radisson hotel and they validate parking so parking is free. let me start by saying the entire staff including the manager has their game together. i've never felt so taken care of. every request (i am super high maintenance) was granted and our waitress and the manager went above and beyond my expectations! i had the sea bass (warning: it shows up with the head still on it). when i cut into it i was surprised that it was stuffed with onions and a hit of red bell pepper. which gave it a wonderful asian-inspired flavor. a teriyaki drizzle served as a decoration that should have been featured because it was delicious. the second person in our party choose the smokehouse burger. i sampled a bite and have to say it's one of the best burger meats i've ever had - it had a wonderful smoky flavor, super lean and juicy. topped with a slice of high quality cheddar cheese and an ample amount of thick bacon. make sure you ask for the bacon to be cooked well done if you don't want it rare. the 3rd person in our party had the jidori 12 chicken which was a huge portion of deliciously marinated chicken accompanied by well seasoned roasted potatoes. he couldn't finish all of it and had a nice to go box for lunch tomorrow. we rounded our meal with the chocolate bourbon bread pudding - delicious! the waitress and manager checked-in with us several times during our dinner and they are one of the reasons we are definitely going back again. bravo firelake grill house - anaheim!|5.0|2021-11-14 15:00:00

"i'll start with saying the food was very good, which is why this review gets 3 stars. my compliments to the kitchen staff. however, the service and ambiance were subpar. this restaurant is in the lobby of the canopy hotel. like, in a wide-open corner of the lobby, so it's more like a typical hotel bar than a restaurant, which we didn't know when booking. it has an outdoor patio, but no interesting views, just a street corner. after being seated on the patio we waited for 5+ minutes without service, until the hostess came back over to tell us ""sorry for the wait, your server is still in the bathroom"". ok..thanks..and gross. when waiter finally showed we ordered drinks and food at the same time and let him know we'd take the check whenever as we had a show nearby to catch in 45 minutes. we were still waiting on drinks 10+ minutes later when the waiter brought the appetizer and said ""oh, i thought someone else brought you your drinks from the bar, i'll go get them now."" thanks. the waiter was overly casual and generally unmotivated. sign of the times i suppose, with good service difficult to find in the restaurant industry. we won't be going back to cobre kitchen, though if we find ourselves in the area again we may check out outrider rooftop lounge on the roof of the canopy hotel. we overheard guests having a cocktail on the patio of cobre kitchen while they waited for their table at outrider say the rooftop lounge had much better views and ambiance, and i would only have to imaginehope better service."|3.0|2021-12-09 00:23:00

the staff were friendly and welcoming. the room was very spacious, warm and quiet. the bed was very comfortable and clean. the bathroom was big and the shower was excellent. i enjoyed my stay here. the price was also very reasonable, considering the amount of hotels that overcharge their customers these days. the car park is very small and tight for modern day cars. i found that it was nearly full, with only about 30 car park spaces in total. i found it very hard to manoeuvre around the corners when driving up or down the levels, and i scraped my car off the wall on the corner. the car park spaces are just enough to park the car into, and you have to squeeze to get out of the car. you are better off parking on the street, but the parking warden comes around at 9am in the morning to check for tickets.|4.0|2022-11-17 01:00:00

the room was clean enough, apart from the mould in the bathroom tile joints. also the location was awesome. all in all, overall experience matches the price. the mattresses were horrible. they were completely sagged - i definitely recommend the hotel buying new mattresses as soon as possible. furthermore, in front of our room was a smoking area and our room frequently smelled of smoke and even weed. lastly, staff couldn't be bothered to smile or say hello when we walked past reception; a little friendliness goes a long way!|2.5|2021-12-23 01:00:00

"the general aesthetics of the place were luxurious and seemed ""high-end"". there were many nice details, including the wallpaper and tiles. this was the worst bed i have slept in for years. i could feel and hear the springs. the mattress was low to the ground, uneven, and extremely hard. if i had not been so exhausted from traveling and the shower completely flooding the bathroom before bed, i would have demanded a better room. there was a bright light outside my window and the curtains were broken (tied up with string), so the neon light came through the cracks in the shades all night."|2.5|2022-10-10 02:00:00

i had asked prior to check in for a room with accessible bathroom which wasn't provided. upon entering the room there were stains and dirty in the carpet. the bathroom tiles were dusty and very obviously dirty. the carpets in the room were very dirty and covered in stains and glitter from previous occupants. the rooms were not cleaned on a daily basis, beds not made etc, which is something you expect from a hotel. on more than one occasion we smelt smoke ( cigarettes i assume) in the corridors coming from other guests rooms. the hotel is definitely not of four star standard. the food in the croft bar was very good, however that is the only redeeming feature of this terrible hotel. reception staff on check in were rude and barely spoke.|0.5|2022-02-13 01:00:00

this was our first time to visit. we had reservations for 5:15 and when we checked in with hostess we asked for outdoor seating. she said there was no availability and gave us a choice of two uncomfortable tables. trevor, our server, was superb as was every single thing we ordered. the food was sublime and the chef rocks! we noticed many walk-ins were being immediately seated outdoors. one couple in line before us, checked in with hostess saying they didn't have reservations but we're staying at the hotel. also many walk ins were seated outside after we were already seated right next to hostess kiosk. when i questioned the hostess, she said the restaurant catered to walk ins and our reservations were actually a disadvantage. i told her she should have given us the option of waiting for an outdoor table, which she did not offer. not happy. we had plans to listen to neil on the piano next door at hotel so went next door and sat in lobby with a beautiful view of the sumptuous patio and felt even worse that we saw several two tops empty. we enjoyed drinks from the bar in the lobby and stayed listening to neil's beautiful music until 8. we so regret not being seated outdoors. everything was so very lovely except the hostess let us down in a big way.|4.0|2022-04-03 04:57:00

location was very central, just on parnell street, after turning from main o'connell street, and very close to shops and supermarkets in the area, such as tesco and lidl. although i had booked a double room, they gave me a family room with an extra sofa bed with the same price. room was large enough and bed was very comfortable. there is no housekeeping service throughout the period in which you stay, so they clean rooms only after you check out. therefore you have to keep your room clean and tidy all the time which contradicts with the idea of staying at a chain hotel.|4.0|2021-12-02 01:00:00
"received absolute terrible service on sunday, party of 7 , manageress very rude i believe her name is sandra, called us liars on a couple of different occasions over a cracked glass and saying something not on the menu that was on the menu, again calling us a liar and getting stroppy.
wrong food was brought out and then had to be took away, no desert offered after maincourse, table not cleared had to clear ourselves, waiter walked past table several times just ignored us, had to go to bar to ask for dessert menu in the end, waiting at the bar to be served for ages and was bypassed for a load of young locals knowing full well i've been stood there 10 minutes waiting then no please or thanks you !
manageress made it very obvious back at the bar that she was tittle tattling about us and on occasions when near our table became very loud!
said my husband could have ice cream off the kids menu ""just this once"" then proceeded to tell him mint choc chip was not on the menu yet it was, then said if he had that he would have to pay more despite the price on the menu for all flavours so he cancelled the ice cream after all the hassle!
we were a party that spent approximately 200 on meals , desserts , pints and cocktails for which we received appalling service and quite bluntly just ruined our day!
before writing this i have emailed the owner of this pub and yet four days later am still waiting a reply. being a local person i do not like to leave negative feedback to any of our local eateries but feel this is the worst i've ever been treated as a regular to this pub."|3.0|2022-04-07 03:00:00

quality of high tea items need to be improved. the cinnamon roll was too dry. the sandwiches were dry too. should have at least 2 drinks selection instead of restricting just to 1 drink. the cost of 1 tea to the hotel is not much but yet enhances the overall experience. compared to other high teas across other hotels, which are of the same price, they offer minimally 2 drinks or free flow. even if it's free flow, how much can 1 person drink within the 2 hours. however the dining experience is greatly enhanced.|2.0|2021-12-12 06:16:00

they delivered a real hamburger to my friend who ordered the vegan burger, he already touched it and ate some of the fries.
then, they took away his hamburger and gave it to the table next to us (think about covid friendly?!)
my other friend had mold on his burger bun.
manager was rude when we asked for shade while it was about 95 out.
they were out of several food items.
while their waiters are doing their very best, the system is working against them and management seems to be lacking hospitality.

i was unable to call property as the number to hotel was taking me through lots of connections, i was tired and cold, stood at the airport border for an hour, so could not think about emailing hotel reception, in effect the hotel main doors were closed, i did knock and was not heard by receptionist, took me time walking around and looking for other entry, to realise that there was a door bell, but not very well visible and sign posted, lights are not very good at the main entry to the hotel. porter said he did not hear my knocking and i should use more power to knock. when i have got the key to room 330, i had to fight with room doors and after several attempts doors finally did open. i was very upset and disappointed with quality of this service, bathroom bath tube has been rusted to the sides of the walls and in the middle of this the white enamel chipping off in few places, of the bath tube. room was a bit cool for me. double bed, hot water in the shower, toiletries, clean and tidy, superior room, quiet room, tea and coffee, hare dryer, iron, stayed in february 2021|3.0|2021-02-01 00:00:00

i was also surprised that when the meal was complete they just dropped off boxes for me to pack my own left overs instead of taking it for me. while i'm used to that at chili's or ""texas roadhouse"" i was at bob's for a different experience.

we loved how spacious the property was, very clean, good parking, we were really excited about our stay. we had hassle with people next door, felt extremely unsafe and were awake all night watching our cars as they had been threatened by people next door, had our door being banged on, rang the hotel not knowing what to do and they told us ring the guards, which we did, had to do it twice and guards came twice, hotel management didn't ask once if we were okay or came to check on us even after we rang them very upset, we stayed for one night, we didn't sleep, felt extremely uncomfortable, we complained the next morning in the hotel like anyone would, i then rang the hotel for 3 days straight and everytime was told the manager would ring me back which didn't happen. both of my parents then had to ring and when they finally got to speak to the manager they got no satisfaction and were told the hotel don't have to do anything to compensate the stay, we had a horrible night and are very upset being told they don't have to do anything so are not going to do anything when in any other hotel if guests were scared,uncomfortable and upset like we were the hotel would do anything to make sure we were happy and make up for the night of hell we had. over a week later and i am still ringing asking is anything going to be done about our horrible stay. the managers attitude that they 'don't have to do anything' is horrible on the phone. we understand what happened with people next door was out of their control but they still should be making sure their guests leave happy, will not be returning here if nothing is done about our night from hell. would not recommend the bella vista either from how we are being treated by staff.|1.5|2021-08-10 02:00:00

"such a beautiful room and a really wonderful location.. esecially if you are lucky enough to be able to park !
the food however was distinctly average and poorly executed, and offered very poor value for money.
the ribeye steak was 33 for simple steak and chips, the steak was presented as a slab of meat, no sliced preparation, no garnish ..lazy execution .
risotto was clearly cooked by someone who does not love nor understand the dish.
the cauliflower popcorn was claggy and missed the crispness that the dish would indicate.
the starter of tomato and burrata was very good however.
would return for the location and ambiance, but not for the food or service, sorry !"|2.0|2021-09-14 08:30:00

"appetizer sampler for $24 was half a plate of cheese no bread or crackers. sold out of la crema pinot bottle and now charge for side salad and bread!! we spent over 300 dollars and were very disappointed.. not worth the value anymore. we have been loyal customers for over 20 years even holding a 50th birthday party.
don't think we are coming back any time soon"|1.0|2021-10-17 18:22:00

perfect airport location. walkable to the airport without heavy bags, or they have an easy shuttle every 15 min. close to airfield, but rooms are quiet. room service food was great, in room entertainment worked. they have the fridges off because of covid, which is meh. but there is a mcdonalds and a petrol station with a big shoppette inside for those who want to dine low cost. nothing actually. it was very easy. the only thing that would've been better is if it were actually on the airport property to make getting to an early flight easier, but this is as close as you can get basically.|5.0|2021-07-08 02:00:00

"airport shuttle our phone was broken, so we couldn't call down to the front desk. we stopped by the front desk and told them that, they just said ""sorry about that."" with no offer to resolve issue. we asked for extra pillows and never received them, and couldn't call to request them again. also, the parking was horrible. they allow airport parking, so it was incredibly hard to find a spot to park on their property."|3.5|2022-06-01 02:00:00

after ordering, the server came back to say the dish was not available - but did not bring a menu for me to chose a replacement. when he came back with menu, i ordered the burger - which my friend had also ordered. then my friend's meal came (burger) and 20 minutes later i still did not have my burger. by then i had to leave since plans at theater next door - so i never got my meal.|1.0|2022-02-04 02:56:00
my husband and i enjoyed a lovely dinner at bacchus recently. initially, we felt a little disappointed when our first 2 wine choices were unavailable. the sommelier came by our table to explain they were having trouble acquiring some of the wines on their wine list. he was very apologetic, and brought us another wine to try, which we both really enjoyed. we were even more pleasantly surprised when at the end of our dinner, we discovered that the bottle of wine was not on our bill. when we noted this oversight to our server, he indicated that the manager had chosen not to charge us for the bottle since the first 2 selections we wanted were not available. this was completely unnecessary, but we greatly appreciated this extra level of quality service. we will definitely be back, not because of the free wine, but because we felt like our business was valued. and the scallops were delicious!|5.0|2021-08-28 13:59:00

i love the way the dining room looks now, great job on the remodeling. the raspberry mimosa was the best mimosa i've ever had. the lobster hushpuppies were very disappointing and definitely not worth the money, didn't like how you only get 5 and the amount of lobster that is actually in them is basically almost like there is no lobster and you are eating a regular hushpuppy. the chicken and waffles were amazing though, loved the peach on top. service was very good until one of my waitress's friends were seated in her section and my waitress proceeded to walk by my table 6 or 7 times without even asking us if we needed anything between her many trips to the friends table, they had ordered before we were even asked if we needed boxes, but all in all brunch was good and will be back sometime next month.|4.0|2021-03-24 03:13:00

the staff was amazing!! made us feel like royalty. the ambience was relaxed. our only complaint is one the desserts was very disappointing. it was not only small, but for the price, it definitely should be more decadent. it tasted like a dry knock off of a hostess suzy q with marshmallow puff. perhaps remove that from the menu and replace it with something more appeasing. keep the size if you must, but when serving a chocolate for dessert in restaurant of this standard,maybe something more sinful that only a bite or 2 would be enough. the grain pilaf served with the chicken entree was overwhelmed with vinegar. did not compliment the savory chicken 1 bit! maybe serve it with a risotto or a tropical jasmine rice pilaf. other than that, the night was a success! and mostly thanks to the wait staff.. joyful, funny, light hearted, made me feel like i was better than family. again, royalty!! thank you.|5.0|2021-10-30 13:28:00

the house was nice. my family had two rooms on the top floor, the bedrooms were cold, the beds were hard and you could feel the springs. the duvets were quite thin, and there were no extra blankets provided. lucky, our room had a single bed which we weren't using, so we put that duvet on our bed too. my son and his partner unfortunately had the same experience. the shower and shower curtain were mouldy, and our bedroom door lock was warn and very difficult to open. i was actually locked in at one stage. i raised that with the very nice staff member as that is very dangerous if fire broke out! there is parking for 4 cars but very tight and i had to move my car twice to let other guests out.|0.5|2022-03-06 01:00:00

the cleanness was unacceptable the toilet brush was full of crap the bed sheets had marks on them the room smelt of stale smoke. when we booked it through booking.com it was stated the hotel was a 3 star, but after we saw the state of the room and researched the hotel it was a 1 start, we will not be booking through your website again.|2.0|2021-08-04 02:00:00

excellent service, good food, reasonably priced. don't choose to sit outdoors though, the noise from the refrigerator trucks in the alley and hvac equipment next door is deafening. had the pork belly fried rice with two eggs. we also had the salad with grilled chicken. desserts were fabulous. service was excellent. breakfast is served alongside their lunch menu until 2 pm which is nice. free validated parking at hyatt centric hotel next door, really convenient compared to many waikiki eateries. i would go here again to try their dinner offerings.|4.0|2021-10-20 05:57:00

"a year ago, we visited the andaz resort, and we fell in love with scottsdale but never tried weft & warp. now we live fulltime in scottsdale and went to phoenix dish fest and w&w had a table with samples of the pork belly and persimmon dessert. we onsnatly made a reservation while at the festival and count wait to try the whole menu.
the resort is stunning, relaxing, and overall a fantastic experience and weft and warp is a beautiful open restaurant with views of the pool and camelback mountain.
i was told by a friend to check out their sunset hour 5:00 pm - 6:30 pm, and we ordered the followingannoyedn
diamondback fizz: corazon blanco tequila grapefruit, lime, jalapeno agave, cucumber, soda
hamachi crudo with roasted bosc pear, pearl onion, thyme vinaigrette, halloumi aguachile, avocado, persian cucumber, shallot, cilantro
pork belly ""porchetta"" with calabrian chile onion soubise, broccolini, fennel pollen, honey
baby kale salad with winter greens, shaved apples, candied pecans, date rings asiago, maple vinaigrette
truffle fries with parmesan, herbs, lemon garlic aioli
duck confit rigatoni with maple leaf duck legs, roasted mushrooms, chestnuts, tarragon, grana padano, port jus
hatch chile rub filet of beef - 8oz grass-fed argentine beef, w&w steak sauce
persimmon me this -gluten-free almond cake, white chocolate persimmon chutney, persimmon chips
all dishes, desserts, and cocktails were delicious, and the staff was engaging and friendly. the team truly knows how to create a relaxing space for hotel guests and locals to gather and eat!
chef dushyant singh even came out and presented us with the slice of paradise, which is a daily surprise, and it was a kings cake he made our meal feel extra special. we can't wait to come back and try the brunch and introduce w&w to our friends."|5.0|2022-03-03 20:27:00
"the food was wonderful as usual and the holiday dessert was amazing!
my favorite (and the best server @ cedar creek) shelly was wonderful as always. my favorite manager janice was working and it's always a pleasure to see her.
the only negative thing i can say is i certainly didn't feel welcome when i checked in with the young ladies at the front desk. unfortunately it's nothing new and as a very regular customer at
cedar creek this area has a lot to be desired. first impressions are lasting and so important.
thanks shelly & janice for being amazing and providing service that always exceeds my expectations."|5.0|2021-12-22 18:56:00

"nothing avoid this place, the worst customer service i've ever received. even worse management. 9 for brandy and coke, 30 for a jug of tea. facilities under maintenence which we wasn't told about, waiting 20 minutes for a knife and fork in unbusy circumstances. its such a shame, the hotel surroundings are beautiful. i complained to 2 managers about my experience to be told ""well it looked like you was having a good time at tour table"" and that just says it all.. absolutely shocking. would never stay here again and my mums 50th birthday was completely spoilt."|1.25|2021-12-03 01:00:00

made reservations through this app. there is a choice between standard seating and outdoor seating. i chose standard, knowing i'm always cold. upon arrival to restaurant, we were taken to an outdoor table. explained what i had reserved and we're taken back to the hostess stand. manager checked and said there's no record on the reservation of standard seating and remarked that she didn't even know what standard seating meant. 20-30+ min wait for indoor seating. went on to say that open table is not connected to them, being a third party they can't see the reservation, and for future reservations to book directly through them. what?!? why be affiliated with an app or service that you can't fully utilize or see customer's full reservation?!? ended up taking the outdoor seating. mgr was very nice though in that she gave us a free appetizer as we'd already had a bad start to the evening by getting in a minor fender bender on the way to the restaurant. just wish the app and restaurant could have better communication about what the customer has reserved.|4.0|2021-05-16 20:24:00

i had called 7 hours prior to our reservation for 3 to see if i could add 2 more to our reservation, and was told you couldn't accommodate that. which was fine till we got there and was seated at a 6 top. did get a hold of the 2 we tried to add earlier to join us, but this postponed our dinner by an hour waiting for them to join up. anjelica was awesome to accommodate our wishes!|3.0|2021-11-14 17:37:00

staff were lovely and helped us with a few extra requests. breakfast was very good although with all the timings we had to abide to with pool etc we could only get the very last sitting and they were clearing away as we were there so didnt get any buffet items. the timing issues really caused us problems. they say to book in advance but some things we could and some we couldnt. and i was online as soon as they were available but still not all timeslots free. the sauna etc were not open and for first time away in a year this was a little annoying esp. for the price. we had deluxe adult room, and while it was lovely, the view was awful and windows that more or less dont open. a balcony would really help these rooms. not worth the extra imo. as we were a group of friends it didnt matter too much as we just wanted a catch up but if it was a couple booking id be annoyed about the price we paid. dinner order was wrong and we got no starters just the mains. but we just went with it as we didnt want to wait another 20 minutes. staff were lovely though|3.5|2021-09-28 02:00:00

"the last three times we have been there with a reservation the entry way seems very confused and seem to struggle with the ipad three people and it should flow better
food is good -garnish has gotten a little underwhelming -can i get more than a leaf of lettuce and one thin slice of tomato on a burger? fries have tended to be cold as well the last few times.
service is very nice helpful and patient offering opinions and recommendations. food is good-worries about maintaining this with the added higher capacity summer crowds in the future."|3.0|2021-03-28 20:35:00

the room looked newly renovated, lovely decor, comfortable bed. the first hotel i think i stayed in that had working air con. someone told me there has been a change in management and i could definitely see that. we had been many times over the last 10 years and loved it but this time we were very disappointed. i go for the amazing cocktails, they were not amazing anymore at all, although the waiter was so nice and we got complementary drinks. the food wasn't great, not a great selection. there was no music or atmosphere. they got rid of the rooftop bar. i would go here for the cocktails and atmosphere and unfortunately that is gone now so i don't think il be picking this hotel again.|6.0|2021-01-17 01:00:00

room was comfortable and spotlessly clean. 430 for a family room for two nights without breakfast was very expensive. found it very impersonal. online checkout, while it's convenient, felt like we didn't matter. i just left door keys on reception desk and left without speaking to anyone. very soon hotels won't need staff. it was like a burden to ask for a drink at the bar which is why we went out for meals and used vending machines for treats which were overpriced. room was directly over the bin storage area which was not very pleasant from 6am, lots of noise. 9 for a glass of wine was a bit pricey too.|3.5|2022-08-08 02:00:00

"very pleasant and served us well on a day (christmas eve) when many restaurants were closed. however, it is less a restaurant than an eating area in the hotel lobby. also, it is contained inside the rose hotel and there are no signs for ""the thorn restaurant"" so if you book on open table and go to the address it's quite confusing."|3.0|2021-12-27 06:05:00

i have a difficult diet to cater for. i don't eat meat or dairy products. eating out can be an unsatisfying experience as i usually end up with very little choice. this was not the case at the candlelight inn. the chef prepared me a superb meal. the lady who served us was very warm and friendly in manner. nothing was too much trouble and everything was done with a smile. it's rare to find a restaurant that exceeds expectations in every aspect of the dining experience, but the candlelight inn is such a place.|5.0|2021-11-13 04:48:00
i was looking to book in paris for late summer 2021 and was looking for a reputable brand or chain of hotels. the accor group cover multiple hotels around paris, including ibis, mercure and novotel among others, along with the pullman chain of upmarket hotels. as a result there are hotels of all price levels in most parts of the city. my main disappointment with the app, is that, along with a list of numerous hotels, it offers to show all these hotels with prices on a map, which is great, if you hit on the icon the details of the hotel come up. however there isn't anyway to clear it until you hit on another hotel icon, but in the meantime most of the map is taken up by the hotel you've clicked on, making the map almost unusable. this i found extremely frustrating, especially on the smartphone where the map is already quite small. i did find that i needed anyway to close out and look at the location on google maps, perhaps if the app was linked with google maps, it would be an improvement. everything else seems to work well, and there's a discount once you log in across most of the hotels.|4.0|2021-05-29 13:36:00

three people for a lunchtime birthday meal. just 3 starters starter and main courses, one cocktail and three bottles of water: 175! though it's a very pretty restaurant, the mitre could do with lowering their prices significantly at lunchtime, or upping their game with the food. the supposed ribeye steak was about a centimetre thick, and though it was quite tasty, it certainly wasn't 35 worth of steak- if we want to spend that sort of money next time, we'll go to somewhere that provides really top quality food and service. it's too much by far to pay top restaurant evening prices for a merely nice level of service (friendly but not very attentive) and just decent food. shame!|1.0|2021-10-16 10:08:00

only one thing would be bathrooms are definitely not up to the standard of the rest of hotel very dated and cramped in small and i found it cramped ,otherwise well placed hotel for pre flight accommodation at a good rate . the rooms are warm comfortable towels toiletries etc were all there . restaurant was good and especially in current situation breakfast was good. stayed in january 2021|3.5|2021-02-02 00:00:00
i honestly enjoyed my stay so much. i was travelling alone and i felt so safe and welcomed by the staff, i was given an free upgrade which was such a bonus for me, in the restaurant the staff were so kind and chatted with me on a few occasions, the food was also delicious. my room was honestly amazing, the bed especially was a dream. and the shuttle bus was so handy for me to get my flight the next morning. i can not wait to come back again, thank you to the lovely staff there was nothing i did not like it was an expectational hotel|5.0|2022-02-21 01:00:00

there isn't many free parking spaces. its first come first served. so you pretty much have to leave your car where it is all day if you dont want your space taken. also would have been nice to have a switch for the main lights beside the bed. absolutely loved that there was a smart tv in the room and the food in alfie's was delicious. would definitely recommend. stayed in june 2021|5.0|2021-06-06 01:00:00
i like a shower head which can be detached from the wall, i cannot easily use a fixed shower. i didn't think to ask about this when i booked, so perhaps i shouldn't complain now. also the choice of bar food was limited and a bit disappointing, i was unable to get a sandwich after 5 pm. excellent service, excellent response from the desk both when we were booking and when we were there. excellent price.|4.0|2021-10-23 02:00:00

i ordered an express breakfast in the morning which i was under the impression on the hotel website that it would be delivered to the room. when it didn't arrive i called below and was advised it was click and collect only. i went to the breakfast room and they didn't have my order but apologised and made it up for me. it's just i was getting a little caught for time that morning. the room was very clean and comfortable and also quiet. the shuttle to the airport runs every 20 minutes which is convenient. stayed in january 2021|4.5|2021-01-21 00:00:00

something is missing sadly. the food was very good which is obviously the most important thing but the staff came across as not really being sure about what they were doing - it was as though they were all training but sadly it felt like that. i was rather surprised when the bill came that we had been charged 3 for an extra jug of red wine jus! hasn't been told there would be a charge & i've never been asked to pay for mire gravy anywhere else. disappointed that we were unable to add a yorkshire pudding to a roast pork too - apparently the chef only cooks enough yorkies for the beef lunches the ambience is lacking. you did feel that you were in a hotel function room which is what it is rather than a restaurant and this killed any atmosphere totally. the food was very good but not sure i'd be back in a hurry sorry.|3.0|2022-01-03 12:06:00

"despite requiring a reservation to ""reduce crowing"" there was a long line where neither social distancing nor the hotel's supposed mask requirements were enforced for breakfast.
once we did get to our table, eventually, way behind the schedule we'd make based on our un-honored ""reservation"" time, we were greeted with a sick kid coughing continually next to us. not something a restaurant and hotel geared towards small kids, many of which cannot be vaccinated, should be tolerating. ask those parents to get room service, offer to cover it instead of the buffet.. something.
on top of all that, the food was mediocre at best.. definitely not a good value for what they charge. better spots in the park.
we took a chance trusting this hotel and legoland with our first family trip since the pandemic started based on their advertised safety measures, which seemed reasonable, and very much regretted it as we discovered they followed absolutely none of them."|1.0|2021-12-31 02:22:00

the welcome was brilliant and at first the staff were very attentive. as the night went on though the level of service fell, we had to take it upon ourselves to find a member of staff to ask for more drinks twice, to ask if we could order a cheeseboard for coffees and finally to ask for the bill. the food was great but because our table was slightly tucked away it felt like we were forgotten about. when we did ask staff for things they were spot on, it would have been lovely though if the level of care, attentiveness and enthusiasm we received on our arrival had continued through the evening .|4.0|2021-12-23 05:41:00
breakfast was included in our rate but others were charged for it. construction was going on so the carpets were dirty and up around the edges. room was old and much smaller than the pictures. view from inside room was an old moldy alley. no ac and it was hot. had to open window and the park was right behind the hotel so live music in the summers goes until 23:00 or longer.|3.5|2022-07-21 02:00:00

pros: training hotel accommodations, training center transportation, a small daily meal per diem, and uniforms/suitcase provided free of charge. cons:very compressed, short and brutal daily training classes hours, i.e. 0530am-230pm or 3pm-midnight daily classes, six days a week. just the very basic faa mandated safety training curriculum taught, no equally important service training, no important crew scheduling training, no computer schedule bidding training. graduation was more lectures, quick power points to study and learn, handed your wings, a few pictures, and back to the hotel to pack up and you are immediately assigned ready reserve assignment, with trip assignments the very next day! good luck finding any place to stay or live in one of six of the most expensive west coast crew base cities! and remember, you will not see your first tiny paycheck until the once a month 20th payday. you better have lots of savings! or generous families. advice to management: advice to management: pay your employees fairly with a livable wage, because it's the right thing to do, not because you can stubbornly draw out l-o-n-g tedious negotiations from work group unions to try and pay as little as possible. look at the pilots union negotiations mess, strike threats, and subsequent 2022 systemwide flight cancellations. or suing the state of california over their new fair pay laws for california workers, losing the lawsuit and then threatening to close all california bases (sfo, lax, san) out of spite, stressing and hurting employees with fear. shame alaska air group management!|1.0|2022-11-02 20:21:00
it is implied that parking was on site but the reality was that it was around the corner. there is supposed to be a walkway through to the hotel but it was closed when we arrived. that meant us walking up a dark side streat with a baby and toddler. also we ate in the restaurant where we ordered a starter however it came at the same time as the mains and we were charged for a main instead of the starter portion. the rooms were a good size and very well appointed. they were very clean. the hotel did a very good job of making it feel covid safe. stayed in january 2021|3.0|2021-01-10 06:00:00

there was a considerable amount of noise on the 4th floor up to c.4am. this noise woke me repeatedly. not good when you have a busy day following. the culprits were not working next day and this raises the question as to why they were allowed to stay there at all. i raised this significant issue with staff but there was no meaningful response. stayed in february 2021|1.5|2021-02-15 06:00:00
location and grounds lovely.. staff friendly (for the most part) good value and facilities had a tasty chicken bacon and stuffing sandwich on arrival which i thoroughly enjoyed as had a long journey.. i was looking forward to the rest of my meals at the hotel but was a little disappointed.. had fish pie on the first evening which was not great.. however i really enjoyed my dessert.. the vegan chocolate tart( surprisingly).. the following morning at breakfast i got a shock as i came across a piece of glass in my bowl of fruit and yoghurt etc.. (the fruit was served in individual pots made of glass.. obviously one was cracked broken) and when i informed waitress she was not apologetic in any way and barely listened to me.. i merely wanted to inform her so that she would be aware that some of these pots may have to be discarded but she was dismissive.. this was disappointing but cooked breakfast was nice. this morning i had pancakes snd bacon which was nice overall i enjoyed the 2 night stay with mum and my sister however i can't forget the experience with the piece of glass..|3.5|2021-08-19 02:00:00

"they barely honored keeping people at a distance. no one wore mask. their bars were very crowded. we asked for outdoor dining and were told after we got there that that required a two hour wait.

"we booked on open table, looking at the menu before we arrived. when we got there and scanned the electronic menu, there were several differences. the meal we had planned to get had increased in price by $20 from the open-table linked menu to the actual menu.
the service was fantastic, the food tasted good, but i don't feel that the food was worth the expense. the outdoor area is great.
we are staying at the hotel and would likely have dinner or at least some appetizers and drinks up there on the rooftop every night but the limited, much too eclectic and high priced menu makes that impossible.
this restaurant needs to ensure that the menu that links from open-table matches what they are serving."|3.0|2021-07-21 20:41:00

tinakilly house is a beautiful country house hotel. the interior is impressive with beautiful art everywhere, antique pieces dotted on shelves, period features to.include the doors, furniture, high ceilings fireplaces. the gardens are immaculately maintained with a fountain feature, outdoor period gazebo, walkways, beautiful beds and flowers, relaxing seating areas. the food in the restaurant is very good, the staff are very obliging and friendly but additional training is required in terms of table service etiquette (it was abit sloppy at times). the rooms are beautiful, very spacious, beautiful views, comfortable bedding, very clean. again lots of period features such as divine dressing table, old wardrobe and artwork. bathroom is very spacious and well supplied but bath and shower abit dated for a 4 star hotel. the hotel is located 10 mins from lovely beaches for swimming and sunbathing. wicklow town is very nice for abit of shopping and lunch out with nice cafes. we had a 2 night night break away and it was very enjoyable. we would definitely return smile shower bath abit dated for 4 star in 2021. white wines were not great. i had the chardonnay. table service in restaurant very rushed and abit clumsy.|4.5|2021-07-23 02:00:00

room and meals were good. when checking in on saturday august 7th was told by receptionist that we could have breakfast on sunday 8th at either 8.00 am or 11.15 am. nothing in between. rather unusual. she said we should have received an e mail in advance advising of this requirement. i showed her copies of all we had received. such advice was not there. we did attend for breakfast at 8 as requested.|3.5|2021-08-10 02:00:00

was close to airport there was a slug in the bed they put me and my partner in two single beds the sockets in the wall were broke. i also didn't like the fact that it was hard to find near the airport no signs and no taxis would help us get there it's a 15 minutes walk|0.5|2021-10-12 02:00:00

very poor service. waited 20 minutes for wait staff to approach table once seated. waited another 45 minutes for food after ordering. the restaurant was busy with outside seating but inside was empty. we were told they had a lot of last minute cancellations, so they should not have been so overwhelmed. we watched our waitress at a computer the majority of the evening. ordered turkey special for thanksgiving so it was probably already made from the earlier buffet. food was mediocre and cold. ordered 3 desserts, and 2 out of the 3 were inedible. very disappointing for the amount of money that we spent. we did have drinks and appetizers earlier in the evening outside, which was very nice. johnny provided great service.|1.0|2021-11-26 20:13:00

we stayed for two nights, the rooms are clean, have a lovely design, are very spacious & well heated with a good sized tv. there was a fantastic selection for breakfast from hot food, fruit, cereal, pancakes to pastries. we also ate in the hotel in the evening the two nights we were there, once again the service was first class as was the food and well priced. pool and jacuzzi facilities are a lovely extra. would highly recommend this amazing hotel, definitely worth the extra few pounds compared to a more basic hotel.|5.0|2021-10-06 02:00:00

this was our second visit to the boat inn and the food was outstanding again. the service was excellent and the waitress was fantastic helping us to make a choice after changing are minds several times. she deserved a medal for her patience! we started with the sharer traditional meat anti-pasta board between three of us and there was plenty. we all tried something different from the main menu, pan fried red snapper, prawn & crayfish raviolloni and fruit di mare they were all divine. we would have liked to try one of the deserts but sadly we were all full to bursting. plus it's an excuse to come back again. the setting is fabulous, we sat inside which is beautiful and comfortable with plenty of outside space too. would highly recommend|5.0|2021-08-29 21:56:00
i arrived at about noon. the room wasn't ready. i went into the oyster bar where i sat for 10 minutes waiting for someone to serve me. i eventually left and ate elsewhere. reception said they would phone when the room was ready and took my mobile number. i came back at 3 and was told without apology that the room still wasn't ready. the receptionist then told me she had said the room would be ready at 3.30 when i left reception at 12. i have no recollection of her saying that. her attitude left a great deal to be desired. not a good start. i've been before. breakfast was good. stayed in june 2021|3.0|2021-06-16 01:00:00

nothing in particular not a 4 star hotel. no air conditioning, very uncomfortable to sleep in 20+ temperatures. mold in the bathroom. didn't get adjoining rooms as requested. lobby consisted of a few chairs right beside the reception and the entrance, no privacy. requested a pint glass from the bar, for the room, glass was very dirty. at best a 3 star hotel, without doubt definitely not a 4 star hotel.|2.5|2021-07-25 02:00:00
"the appetizers were great, however, they forgot to bring one of our diners dinner and once it was brought out, the center of the fish was cold. gross! our server never came back to see if we needed more water through the whole meal. one of our diners got up and grabbed the pitcher of water herself to fill our tables water glasses because we had waited so long. the food runner denied taking dirty dishes off of the table because ""it wasn't his job"". it's a shame because we used to like this place and wanted to try it out now that it is under new owners. sadly, we will not return."|2.0|2022-01-23 15:41:00
ambiance was nice, looked great, drinks were quality and service and location were perfect! food was sadly not that good. normally dont write a ton of reviews but really felt a little ripped off by a 40$ meal that tasted like it was day old frozen .. over cooked and bland. i thought it was me until my dining partner said the same (neither of us wanted to admit it because we spent so much!!).. anyway, would go back for drinks but not seafood.. cool looking place though!|3.0|2021-06-03 20:38:00

food was exceptional quality!! very pricey, but bloody good.
advice: wait for refurbishments to be finished before booking, not worth the money while eating at the bar with drunk people and football in the background. would have given 4 or 5* if not for the above."|2.0|2021-09-09 15:59:00

amazing location. had a nice bar and restaurant attached. walking distance to malahide the hallways were noisy. guests seem to like to chat in the hall or go from room to room, i could hear it all. after one particularly loud night the hotel put signs up the next day. i assume someone complained so it wasn't just me. not really their fault and they did act on it right away.|4.0|2022-04-02 02:00:00

the grounds were beautiful and the spa was a pleasant added bonus. there was dust on some of the fittings and furniture e.g., bedside lamps and the stand of the coffee table. the lock on the bathroom door of my aunts room was faulty and she was locked in the bathroom and had to climb out of the false wardrobe door. for the size of the mugs in the rooms, the milk supply is inadequate and i appreciate we could have requested more, but for a facility of this standard, sufficient provisions should already be in place. the food service at the bar in the evening wasn't what we had expected in that when we ordered dessert it took at least 30 minutes if not more to arrive even after i had alerted the staff that we had been waiting a long time. when paying our bill i mentioned this to the manager and he said there was only one dessert chef on that evening and other diners had to wait too. however, i explained that we were not told about this and no reason was given when the dessert finally arrived. the dessert was taken off the bill which was appreciated, but if there is going to be an excessive waiting time, i think diners should be informed of this and then have the choice of wishing to continue with their order or not.|4.0|2022-05-26 02:00:00

the location is lovely, remote and quiet. the staff were so helpful and relaxed, really friendly people. i had an issue with my room and was immediately moved. i saw three of the houses and although one was a little outdated (in decor only) all were spotless and comfortable. we also brought our dogs and just loved being able to do this. everyone seemed very calm and welcoming to them on the property and we were close to the lakes, some great hikes and close enough to tuamgraney and skarriff to get a restaurant and pub when we wanted. if you are looking for a taxi, call this great man 0877630368 the small patio areas really need gates, for both kids and dogs but other than that we were happy out!|4.0|2021-09-10 02:00:00

the room was nicely decorated and it was good to have a balcony. great location and very clean room. staff were friendly but have not been helpful. the electricity in our room went off when we were getting ready for a night out. it was off for at least 2 hours because the maintenance man went home at 3pm on a saturday and we were told that they couldn't get him back. the staff were friendly but no electricity meant we couldn't properly get ready for a night out or charge phones etc. there was no alternative room offered and no offer of compensation. the maintenance man finally arrived, but took my friend's hairdryer when he left (we didn't realise until the next day). he must have mistakenly thought it was our hairdryer that had blown the electricity, but it was the one next door (not ours) and when my friend rang to ask the next day, they'd thrown it out. no follow-up from management when they said they would, and 3 weeks later we are still chasing the hotel for a refund for the hairdryer that was taken, as well as some sort of follow-up from management.|2.0|2022-05-25 02:00:00

"i ordered the spicy margarita and couldn't drink it because it was way too spicy. i know it's supposed to be, but it wasn't the right mix of spicy and sweet that it should be. also, the farmer's burger was not very tasty. that said, the kid meals were perfect..chicken tenders and mac and cheese. my husband got a regular burger and he enjoyed it.
the appetizer was not very good. it was the artichoke dip but it tasted like it was reheated.
the waitress was outstanding. super kind and very attentive. all the customer service was actually outstanding. the ambiance is awesome for families."|4.0|2021-11-12 21:26:00
the hotel parking was chaotic and not fit for purpose. valet parking for 1 car room or apartment. car park was tiny with cars parked bumper to bumper. poor valet had to move 5 cars by backing them up a ramp onto small side road to let our car out on 1st night. found out then than for 5 could park car for the day in car park just 5 min walk away. can't understand why hotel don't just tell all to do this & just use hotel car park for drop offpick up. with covid, valet parking seems ridiculous too. apartment location was really close to galway city centre, 5mins walk to eyre sq. stayed in july 2021|4.0|2021-07-05 01:00:00

we were fortunate to book on a sunny day so didn't need the heater. service was pretty good although the slimline tonic asked for was a normal one! two of us had the meat platter and one the single beef burger. the meat of both was tasty although the burger a little dry and not special enough for the price. our issue was the chunky chips were soggy and these and the normal fries suffered enormously from cooking in old fat evident from the smell and taste. sad, because we couldn't fault our last meal when the orangery was up.|3.0|2021-04-28 17:50:00

we were seated for 15 minutes before someone came over and introduced themselves. the heat was sweltering, which was no one's fault, but at the very least we could've been provided with water to compensate. there seemed to be some sort of corporate event there that had priority over regular patrons and it was absolutely unacceptable. especially considering that after the event, service magically improved.|2.0|2022-02-13 19:33:00

"first time here, we wanted to give it a try and experience the steakhouse in the heart of old scottsdale. if it were not for the efforts of manager kenny and gm german we would have given this one star at most. note *scottsdale has a plethora of really great steak houses to choose from. they all have unique ambience and cater to their own specific crowd.
however from the moment you enter stk you get the sense of the crowd they cater to is tourist, bachelorettes and the single older guy crowd. be prepared to wait 40 to 60 minutes even with a reservation. we had a 6 o'clock reservation and were told to go to the bar. after 20 minutes my husband was fuming. after 30 minutes he was ready to leave. kenny the manager offered to buy us a drink at the bar which went a long way towards alleviating the situation. after 45 minutes we were told our table was finally ready.
keep in mind that the main dining room is very small. not many people can be seated at this restaurant. i'm not sure what they can do about this but it seems at the bar area is the main way that stk serves their patrons. we sat down and ordered drinks, a 10 ounce fillet and my husband requested a special short rib mac & cheese. after the waitress said it would be extra $30 we said fine. what got sent out was a mac & cheese with maybe two scant pieces of short rib on it. so unbelievably stingy. in addition, the fillet was not 10 ounces it looked much smaller.
it was at this time that the general manager, german walked over. he literally saved the entire night. he spent time talking with us about our experience and wanted to make sure the food issues were addressed. german has worked at the wynn hotel amongst many other upscale places and as a result he brings an enormous amount of experience and sophistication to stk. he made sure a side plate of short what was sent over and a proper steak in addition. i feel that under germans guidance stk can become a more upscale scottdale destination."|4.0|2021-11-15 00:02:00

the hotels looks very impressive, as if you were in a villa from previous century. furniture and room design all were aligned. it felt like in a fairy tale. the bed was huge and comfortable. we could regulate the temperature in the room. the bathroom was huge with shower and bathtub and two sinks. very comfortable armchairs and extra tables for placing your stuff. also a mini table with all needed for an extra cup of tea or coffee. as regards breakfast, it was quite good. there was the option of ordering warm food (like an irish breakfast, or pancakes, or salad). also warm porridge was available and toast. people were very polite and helpful. we even got an extra pancake after asking. the only bit is that the hotel is like a 10 min walk from the city so to say. it is not a huge problem, but when you are tired or really hungry, one would appreciate being closer to the city and not doing the walk. but all in all, that is not a big issue at all. if you have a car, then its a great choice for your stay.|5.0|2022-04-07 02:00:00

this restaurant is amazing. it is located outside the cluster of portland's better restaurants and seems to get by on a loyal clientele of regulars. the neighborhood is not the fanciest. there seems to be plenty of parking (we walked from our hotel). the food is just fantastic. every course was imaginative and a bit unusual, with very carefully chosen seasonings. no need for salt or pepper, or anything else. we had grilled octopus, beet salad, shaved fennel salad, and porkchop. the chop was cooked perfectly; to my taste the sauce was saltier than i like. that was the only deviation from perfection. the wine list is very attractive. we had a moderately-priced bottle of chenin blanc which was probably the best we have had anywhere. we are so glad that we stumbled on this restaurant and we are eager to return.|5.0|2021-11-06 03:48:00

i read all about the amazing easter brunch buffet online and made a reservation for 8 people at 1:15pm. we were so excited to be able to enjoy it. unfortunately it took a very long time for the waiter to even come to the table and acknowledge our presence. he never even poured us glasses of water the entire meal the water cups remained upside down. when taking our drink order he was in such a rush that he skipped over one of my guests. when asked about one of the special drinks on the menu he knew nothing about them and had to read it off the card on the table. he was no where to be found every time we needed him. the plates were never cleared until the end of the brunch. our dirty silverware was never replaced in between courses. he was reluctant to keep pouring our bottomless mimosas that we paid extra for and seemed annoyed when we asked for refills. when we asked for coffee with dessert it came when we were almost finished our dessert and he did not bring cream or sugar caddies. when he did the cream curdled in the coffee and the sugar caddies were almost empty so we had to wait even longer for him or actually other staff to deliver full ones with sugar in the raw and splenda. this was not an inexpensive meal and the service was absolutely terrible. i understand for large parties that the tip should be included but this waiter did not warrant the 19% tip he included on the bill. he even dropped the check and took off well before we were finished with our meals. what was supposed to be a wonderful brunch with my family ended up being a disappointment. the poor service overshadowed our meal and took away from how delicious the food actually was. the lamb chops, sushi bar and raw bar were outstanding. the shrimp themselves were large and flavorful. i paid a hefty sum for this brunch and left completely disappointed.|2.0|2021-04-06 21:05:00

friendly welcome from staff. room was basic but had everything we needed. excessive noise disturbance from other guests in the early hours (arriving from the pub and congregating in the corridor while screaming, shouting and playing music. after 40 minutes of no sign of stopping we tried to call repectionconcierge for over 25 minutes before finally getting a response. our sleep was badly effected. i raised this at check out and was advised a manager would call me on the following tuesday however we never heard from them. the noise was out of their control to their extent but quicker action would have meant it was resolved. instead we were kept awake for a long time and were not well rested for the wedding the next day. also a lot of noise disturbance from the bar accross the road. didnt feel worth the money we spent for these reasons or how basic the room was. lighting also wasn't great particularly in the bathroom.|1.5|2022-07-29 02:00:00

i liked the staff in the spa and leisure area. room was lovely brilliant view we were on the top floor. we left us dessert for our honeymoon in our room. i really liked kerry down in the spa area she was lovely she painted my nails and put gorgeous cranberry scented cream on my hands after. fridge in our room was hot and never cooled down. front desk staff at arrival were nice but through out our stay we felt like we were being judged for wearing comfy clothing. we had no restrictions at all. i know the restrictions were lifted but they had everyone on top of each other in the barrestaurant i didn't like this at all i suffer from anxiety i had to leave and stay in my room for the rest of the night. another night there was no suitable food for a vegetarian except a curry which i didn't want the food i did have mash gravy veg was rotten. the click and collect menu was worse no vegetarian option then wouldn't even make me a toasted sandwich so i had to order off just.ie. the breakfast i was charged 13.90 for a slice of toast, 2 tiny fruit jars and a apple juice i found this ridiculous.|2.0|2022-02-12 01:00:00

"actually, i don't give them any stars. this is a restaurant in harrah's ac-marina. when we arrived at the appointed time we found out that the hotel decided to not open the restaurant that night. the woman at the desk had no explanation when i asked how that could occur with standing reservations (and no notification.) strangely, another restaurant to it's left, that was supposed to be closed that night, was open - and so that was where we dined.
this was but one example of our experience at harrah's this year for a conference. i would rate the overall hotel as a days inn quality masquerading as a five star resort."|1.0|2021-10-28 14:40:00

"avoid rooftop at wayfarer hotel dtla. i took my wife there for a special lunch date and we had a very bad experience. it started off with the hostess whose first words to me were to demand ""what's the name on the reservation?"" no hello, no welcome. she looked so stressed and unhappy. she got us seated where we waited 10 mins for a server to arrive. when he did he was carrying a stack of water glasses, enough for all the tables who had been waiting for him, with the top water glass tucked under his chin. he had a mask on but it was down around his neck so he was breathing into the stack of glasses his customers would be drinking from. nasty. he apologized for leaving us for so long without water on a hot day and left the *empty* water glasses on our table to give out the remaining glasses to others. the server also looked unhappy and like he wished he could be anywhere else but at work. he came back about 5 mins later with water bottles for the tables in our area, again carrying several in such a way that he was breathing into the open bottles. he finally came back to take our order later, and we were seriously thinking about just leaving. we went ahead and ordered though, and asked the server to bring us some clean glasses, since the ones he had brought us had someone's lipstick on them. also nasty. the tables around us had umbrellas at this rooftop restaurant, but they had neglected to purchase bases for the umbrellas, so they flopped around every time the wind blew. one of them came within inches of my wife's head - i had to grab it in flight to stop it from hitting her. one of the other tables complained about the umbrella problem which caused the manager to come over. he told the gentlemen at that table that he was doing the best he could but there was nothing he could do about the lack of bases. he said ""you can either have the umbrellas or sit in the sun."" from this we knew that all the employees there are miserable. avoid rooftop at wayfarer hotel dtla!"|1.0|2021-09-07 20:22:00

when we arrived and requested inside seating, the hostess informed us that since we made the reservation only 4 days in advance, we would have to be seated in the patio area. there were 2 large groups out there and the noise level was unbearable. for most of the meal we were unable to converse without shouting. the waitress was nice but overwhelmed. we will not be returning.|1.0|2021-12-12 12:46:00

we always enjoy eating here. its consistently delicious and unique. it's a bit expensive so don't come here if you're a tight wad or have picky kids. love sitting on the patio any time of the year, they have well placed ceiling heaters. the ocean views are lovely anytime but particularly sunset. very quiet patio, serious sexy date vibes. our favorite apps are the crab rangoons and wagyu beef. the chocolate dessert is perfecto!|5.0|2021-12-04 09:01:00
we enjoyed the polite service. the food was enjoyable, however a bit overrated in my opinion. popovers seemed a bit dry, caesar salad dry and still tasted like anchovy even though we asked to not add them. the mashed potatoes, and balsamic mushrooms were delicious. the steak was delicious. overall it was good.|4.0|2021-06-18 21:58:00

"the price & location of this restaurant are all that are worth it. the service was close to nothing- we sat with empty waters & empty drinks multiple times & no waiter to check on us. when she finally did, because we asked the person bussing the table to help us, no apologies were made, nor did she check if everything was good with our order. we also experienced a issue with our reservation, i checked with the moxy hotel & the restaurant several weeks before our trip if one person entering under 21 would be okay with our reservation, i was told multiples times that it would be okay since we were dining before brunch & before dinner she would be clear. we got to the restaurant and they denied her entry- i spoke to a hostess and she did try to help me, she even said she was letting the entry person know downstairs the situation and still denied her. tried getting a ""manager's"" assistance and was only given rude customer service, the woman at the door was doing everything in her power not assist us, she just kept repeating that the restaurant & the hotel were not associated so if the hotel said we could bring her, they were wrong .. no concession at all and it was a 5 pm reservation. on top of that, a few hours later i checked my email & they had even tried to push our reservation back without a call or email to 6:30-- i only found out because open table notified me. the place is pretty and cute to take pictures, food was great, not the best, but decent-- other than that, i wouldn't waste my time coming back here."|2.0|2022-01-31 08:26:00

the hatch has been my local for over 20 years and i regard it very fondly indeed. the food is reliably good, the service always friendly and cheerful and the setting on the ashdown forest is idyllic. the outdoor dining (and drinking spaces) have benefitted enormously from considerable investment during the pandemic and the only negative is the challenge of parking on a busy weekend lunchtime|4.0|2021-07-01 10:39:00

the strong smell from the kitchen at breakfast came right up to our room and it wasn't a great smell to be fair. maybe invest in a few air purifiers and have them on throughout the building at breakfast. breakfast itself was very poor. we both got a full irish, fried egg was overcooked and hard, tomato wasn't cooked at all. guests were still allowed get up and get there own toast, coffee, juice etc at breakfast. felt uncomfortable as it was quite busy and felt no social distancing was being adhered to. staff were all very friendly. bathroom was very modern. toiletries provided were great even had tooth brushes. stayed in june 2021|4.5|2021-06-27 01:00:00

"the food has been phenomenal all 3 times i've visited, but the service has been consistently poor. i assumed the first two services were poor due to covid-related adjustments. but this last visit just proved it's a regular occurrence. after being seated we waited over ten minutes before having to flag down the waiter just to get water. we were forced to wait excessive amounts of time to order drinks and then more time to order food. towards the end of our meal we saw our waitress with purse in hand seemingly off-shift ready to go home pretty odd considering we hadn't gotten our bill yet.
i empathize with the chaos and constant demands that are food service. we're all allowed off days. but three for three in poor service really undermines the beautiful and amazing food being served."|3.0|2022-03-26 17:24:00

we got a groupon voucher as a gift which included dinner in this restaurant. on arrival at 7.30 the restaurant was almost empty, very quiet and zero atmosphere. the offer we had was a 2 course meal, we were given a set menu which was very poor choice and different to what's advertised on the website. for me this menu was not what you would expect in a 4star hotel. as we didn't like anything on this menu we asked could we eat in the bar instead and they agreed. the bar was much better, lots of atmosphere and the food was good(usual bar food) the staff were the real added value, so helpful, fast and sound! tom in the bar was 100% the best thing about our dining experience!!|1.0|2022-03-12 13:09:00

stayed at the castle hotel and ate here for breakfast and dinner on two different days. breakfast was buffet and it was decent. i liked that the cost was included with our stay. for dinner, i had the new york steak one night and the salmon the next and both were good. they cooked the steak perfectly to my liking.|4.0|2021-10-26 00:33:00

ashdown park is a beautiful hotel, very nice decor & all within a 10minute walk of gorey town shops & restaurants. the room was comfortable & cosy. breakfast was lovely and lots of selections to choose from. the staff could of been more attentive as we had to leave our table every time to get another drink. we had booked into the restaurant for food, we then had to call a staff member over to make an order of food after waiting 30mins to order but considering the times hotels over book and are understaffed.. the phone & hairdryer in the room wasn't in working order.|3.5|2022-08-12 02:00:00
"welcome warm, ambience delightful, food very tasty. in or booking, we were given only a 5 minute slot within which to arrive, but traffic problems made ua later than we had expected. nevertheless, we were still warmly welcomed. |parking can be a bit of a problem; there is parking in the square and in busy times it can be a problem. this time, however, it was a saturdau lunch time, and someone moved out just as we arrived. menu was good, although i suspect it remailns the same at least for some time, but the quality was veru good indeed. as the afternoon wore on, things became somewhat noisier, dissficvult with hearing aids! bur we certinaly will comem again."|5.0|2021-11-22 01:06:00
hello, most disapointed - when we arrived at the pub 6.00, after a long coastal walk, for my wife's birthday booking..a sign on the door stated 'closed due to staff shortages' - thats all fine & understandable during these covid-days - but we recieved no notification..had to drive off & locate an alternative. this is very poor service. richard|1.0|2022-02-03 19:39:00

i booked a king room - which showed the updated bathrooms etc in all the pictures. on arrival to our room we were early so we paid for the room and headed into the centre for somthing to eat, when arriving back around 4pm to get our room key, we arrived to a very old dated bathroom. the room looked nothing like what i was led to believe i had booked. when phoning reception to query this, we were told the nicer rooms had all gone when we asked how as we paid for one the male receptionist was very rude and said people checked in before us (dispite) us arriving 3 hours early and paying for the room. he was very rude and said if we didn't like it to come and get a refund and stay elsewhere. the room option i booked had a few extra also robes etc and a dressed room - again our room didn't have any if this. a manager came to our room and apologised as it shouldn't of happened with two bottles of water and tiny box's of chocolates.. which we felt for litterly being 5 all together after the wrong room being given and the rudeness of the receptionist was a bit of a kick in the face. the bathroom was very dirty including eyelashes left laying beside the bath taps. also not far above the main doors so heard people shouting and comming in and out al night. the staff & rooms allocated are big what you're paying for|2.5|2021-07-08 02:00:00

the receptionist team needs a call of attention. they denied me the service when i tried to book my room in the front desk, without even bother to look the availability in the hotel, both of them affirmed me that the hotel was fully booked. i went outside and i booked my room trough this app, just out of curiosity i kept looking for rooms during the night in the same area and every single time the hotel was the first option so they definitely had availability and more than one room to offer. i felt it like a racist act, despicable and a shame coming from a nice place like that. you definitely expect a better customer service! i like the food and the rooms but the front desk was so bad that they totally ruined my experience of being there for sure. stayed in june 2021|0.5|2021-06-21 01:00:00

very overpriced for mediocre food. clearly mark has taken his eye off the ball! it is a pub serving food and as such you should go expecting that. it is not fine dining or anything special. even though they charge as if it is! if you are visiting in winter go dressed warm as the eating area is in a lean to on the back of the building and so very sortdraughty. shame as tempting us out of our warm comfy home in the depths of winter we expected to be warm, sat on comfy seating and be served professionally and with great local food. sadly this didn't happen. it is a very dog friendly pub and as such expect owners dogs loose around the eating area. expect to pay for mediocre food at london rates and still expect to pay the full price for it, have items missing but still pay for it, be laughed at by your server and then still take your service charge for such service! we are local & look to try local restaurants to recommend to our lovely guests sadly this one didn't hide it. we are currently in the middle of a 20 day restaurant tour and so far have been amazed and wowed by sone truly great local food & service. we'd advise to avoid and try other great places as there's so many that are better: seaside boarding house, ollerod, station kitchen, fleur de lys, halbury cottage to name but a few we've been to this past two weeks! simply put poor service, mediocre food, overpriced - read the reviews - wish we had! 150 wasted enough said|2.0|2021-12-30 12:34:00

the only thing was the room across the hall was quite loud going in and out so this woke me up a couple of times. location very good for the airport and reception arranged the taxi and called me in the morning to let me know it had arrived. it took the stress out of an early start stayed in march 2021|4.0|2021-03-17 00:00:00

the staff, service, food and value for money for oscars gets top marks. the only reason there's not full marks for the entire experience is that the access to the restaurant was not great. we got a disabled space easily (right by the entrance) but my mother-in-law found the steps to get into the hotel difficult (getting her to the ramp with her walker would have been even further for her to walk) and then the automatic doors didn't fully open (they jammed but opened if pushed) and then finally there's another door that has to be manually opened, which isn't easy when trying to help a someone who has difficulty walking. quite a stressful experience.|4.0|2021-11-23 09:52:00
"excellent food, service was brilliant and super friendly and helpful. wine choice is on the small size and a lot in a higher price points but we did find 2 excellent bottles within a reasonable budget (for us). really calm yet modern setting with gorgeous furnishes. we will definitely be back as the food was 5*

"after specifically requesting a quiet table for a disabled guest, i could see a table for four at the end of the bar towards the back of the premises that i thought was surely ours, but was told not so, and was offered a table at the end, with cramped access and next to a baby shower. i noted that the reserved table i thought fit my criteria and naturally assumed was ours, was not occupied for at least half of our stay if not more. the restaurant was only half full, and i had been very clear about what was needed.
, so to be seated by an open door with annoying flies and in the noisiest half of the restaurant was disappointing. i don't think it's incumbent upon me to specify what kind of disability a guest has, the request should be processed using common sense. also, our two guests walked in unchallenged through the open door near our table, without their temperature being taken or any contact details. the food was reasonable, the steak was good i have to say, but as our first restaurant meal in nearly two years, the final bill did resonate as an effort to claw back lost revenue from last year, a fish pie at 13.95 with no sides? my dad recommended bill's to us as our daughter is soon moving to lewes and it would have been a great introduction to the town. i'm left feeling a bit deflated with the whole experience, as what was intended to be a quiet but celebratory meal for a completed degree, finished with our first thought afterwards being what could we get to eat on the way back to our hotel."|2.0|2021-06-27 13:25:00
can't honestly say outstanding for the food as it wasn't that sort of meal. it was great - casual, tasty and just what we were looking for with a glass of wine with neighbours. we had starters (crab tartine) plus some truffle and parmesan chips and that was filling enough. and the outdoor huts are perfect for privacy and safety.|5.0|2021-06-16 13:49:00

"disappointed. just after we placed our order, the waiter was sent home. we received our food a bit later from different waitstaff but everything was lukewarm at best. we never saw that staff person come anywhere near us for the remainder of our dinner.
our baked potatoes were somewhat dry, as if sitting under a heat lamp for a while. our prime rib and filets were tender but also appeared to have been sitting on a counter for a while. because of restrictions, we tried to have our order not include peppers or onions, but were unable to get the request heard, so that food was wasted.
while eating our dinners, we tried to get the attention of other staff but all seemed too busy. we later stopped a ""busboy"", who brought us a waiter who provided a dessert we ordered and then apparently when he realized we had had no service, gave us another dessert. he was apologetic and did provide limited service as he was busy with several tables, including one with a dozen customers.
it's a nice relaxed atmosphere but we expected more. we believe that outback next door would have been more responsive to is as customers."|3.0|2021-11-24 14:59:00

the restaurant was decorated beautifully and the ambience was wonderful. however the food was a different story. everything on the menu was allacart. i ordered crabcakes and we were given one small roll each at the beginning. we were never offered any additional rolls. the crabcake was cold when it arrived. i would say the food was just alright. i am not a big eater however i left the restaurant hungry.the entire bill was $125 and we each had one drink $13.00 a piece. in my opinion the amount of food that was served was not enough and was extremely overpriced. it would've been nice if they would have thrown in a salad or a cup of soup but even that was an additional cost. i doubt that i will ever go back there again.|2.0|2021-12-20 12:43:00
went for valentine's dinner, but on sunday since we assumed it would be less crowded. it was, which worked well for us! they had a few specials running, which looked very nice. we got cocktails (very nicely crafted) and the fried calamari. we both got a seafood pasta dish (salmon lemon caper and the seafood linguini). both dishes were excellent! the roasted mushroom side was ok, nothing super special, but still tasty. it was simply presented on a sideb&b plate and appeared to be mostly button or cremini mushrooms, i was expecting slightly more in variety and i think it would have looked nicer if it was in a dishramekinsmall cast iron pan. it just looked like a scoop of mushrooms on a plate, which compared to the way the other dishes were presented, it was a little lack luster, but still very tasty. we did a duo of gelato for dessert, which was very good and super cute in the tall martini glass. the decor is quite nice and it was just perfect for a nice dinner out, but not too stuffy, i would deem in elegant yet approachable. it was our first time and we were very happy with our experience and look forward to coming back to try the gnocchi and risotto!|5.0|2022-02-16 05:03:00

zero check backs to the table, which is basic service.

unfortunately as i spot check for bugs when i travel and when i arrived the sheet underneath was filthy and very concerning. stains, hairs and black flecks all over. i could not relax at all and actually had 4 bites on my legs after staying. the hotel is central but very noisy outside and there was a party next door which we had to report ( in the middle of a pandemic?) there was construction noise at 7.308amd which woke us up. although the hotel did promptly shut down the get together of drunken people playing loud music. i would ask the hotel to genuinely check their mattress protector and keep them cleanm it was very disgusting and we could not relax. in between the couch was filthy also. in fairness the hotel were great at responding and it wasn't there fault but they need to keep an eye on their bed cleanliness. this is dangerous. the hotel cleanliness in the common areas (lifts etc) could be way better especially as we were essential travelling and needed to feel like things were cleaner although there was hand sanitizer it didn't replace the need for the cleaning overall. the facilities inside were good and aside from the bed it was clean enough. good cooking facilities and good for a short stay. good set check in. good central location. nice view from the apartments. stayed in april 2021|1.5|2021-04-07 01:00:00

"the spread has too much sweets(unique but very sweet). there should be more savoury items to balance the spread.
service was not as good as i had expected. for such high end hotel, the service should be much better. staff should have been more attentive and make more rounds to clear the dirty plates and cutlery. but we often had to ask them to do so (and often had to look out for the staff - as we sat at the extreme end of the restaurant, we saw that the staff were standing at the other end of the restaurant)."|3.0|2021-12-18 04:53:00
clean, easy to find, good food booked an executive suite as we were going on a honeymoon from recently getting married so we wanted a little bit of luxury. arrived to a beautiful room only to discover there was no hot water or heating working, we spoke to reception around 5pm to let them know. by 9pm we were told we had to be moved because it would not be fixed that evening. we were moved to a disappointing 1 bed apartment which was situated outside the hotel, it was no where near the luxury in which we had first booked. this left us extremely deflated for the rest of our 2 night stay. they gave us complimentary dinner as an apology to which they charged us extra for ordering steaks and charged for 2 soft drinks we had ordered! we are so disappointed with the level of customer service and i would not recommend going here for any kind of special occasion.|2.5|2021-09-29 02:00:00

the staff were so lovely! the room was immaculate with a gorgeous wall window. i loved the atmosphere within the hotel. it is about a 10 minute drive away from the town but i felt there was a little community to ourselves at the hotel. we had to wait about 50 minutes to get checked in. we did arrive at 3pm, like so many others and there was a large queue when we arrived. a lady did greet each visitor in the queue and i was offered a seat and a coffee and to stay with the bags while my boyfriend continued to wait in line. once we checked in, our room was still not ready but we could leave our bags in the luggage room and we enjoyed a drink at the bar while we waited. we didn't go back to ask about our room until 6pm, of course it was ready when we went back to the desk (the queue had gone down at this stage). this did not dampen our spirits at all and we had a lovely dinner after that and breakfast the next morning! i am very happy with the staff and service, they couldn't do much more than that!|4.5|2021-08-07 02:00:00
the bathroom was really badly maintained with rust coming out from the side of the bath plus reems of white silicon along the sides of bathtub. the cupboard doors were hanging off and the overall maintainace standards were awful. we had dinner and the restaurant staff were totally overwhelmed when someone tried to make a booking. service was slow and yet again seemed like the restaurant needed more staff, food was mediocre at best. the return shuttle from airport to hotel were late and had to be contacted outside airport car park and were not very apologetic, blaming the reception staff. reception staff were giving out wrong pre paid parking tickets for parking gate which meant people had to park and go back into reception to get separate tickets at 12 at night. i honestly can't understand the price point for this hotel, overall we would not say again.|1.0|2021-10-19 02:00:00

beautiful hotel and grounds. bedrooms are spacious and well furnished. the breakfast room was also spacious and very airy. i had dinner 1 night and the food was excellent. however i find as a solo traveller i can be ignored and this happened on a few occasions. at dinner i had to get the wait staff attention, no one checked my table to see if i needed anything. so i had to chase to get another glass of wine etc. the bedroom was warm with a heavy duvet on the bed. could this be changed to a blanket and sheet in the summer? some staff greeted me as i travelled thought the hotel but the majority didn't. it's a simple thing to do.|4.5|2021-09-09 02:00:00
"haven't been to this restaurant since the pandemic began. it was nice to see a healthy, boisterous crowd inside, opted for outside dining for safety and the possibility of conducting a conversation.
pleased to note the food was good and our server was very attentive.
the downside to dining outside is the heaters. unfortunately, the heaters are small, limited extension cords which kept ours far from the four diners. our reservation was for 5:45, we were promptly seated but the heater did not keep us from the cold. would have liked to sample the dessert menu but the cold won out.
strongly suggest a better heating option for those in the hotel entrance. the wind swirls about negating the limited effect these heaters from mitigating the cold.
doubtful we will return until the weather warms."|3.0|2022-03-13 03:33:00

"we were running late for arrival (satnav!) and telephoned to request a delayed reservation which was swiftly and happily approved.
on arrival the carpark was refreshingly large and provided non cramped parking.
the young waiting staff were all immaculately turned out and were very polite and efficient.
the starters were very tasteful and well presented.
the roast beef (sunday lunch) was of the highest order both in quantity and quality and cannot be praised too highly.
we sadly could not manage a pudding but the coffee went down a treat.
however the biggest surprise was the bill .. less than 60for two all in!

the only good thing about the entire experience was our steak. considering it's a steakhouse, i'm at least glad the steak tasted good. the atmosphere is strange because it's in a hotel lobby so it's hard to make it feel like a nice restaurant. for the price everything else we had was just ok. the salad, cocktails and pasta were just ok. the service was not great. we asked for recommendations and our waiter was not very helpful. we were served steak and then had to wait for steak knives, plates to be cleared, etc. i would really expect a top notch experience for the price. i recommend going to oak or steak 48 for an incredible dining steakhouse experience that is actually worth the price.|2.0|2021-10-24 09:22:00

"this restaurant is in the lobby of the canopy hotel. i highlight that because it is literally in the lobby, and this played a role in the experience we had.
we made reservations for the new years eve dinner at $110 per person (prepaid). it was a set three course menu and sparkling wine toast. a little expensive, but it was new years eve.
it took 10 minutes for someone to bring water. 5 more minutes for the waiter to introduce himself and his trainee (training on new years eve??). we ordered drinks and it took another 10 minutes to get them. the waiter didn't take any time to set up the experience or explain the menu, just asked for our order. there were three courses with three to four choices on each course. he also told us we needed to order everything at once, which felt a bit rushed, but he said they would pace the courses. we selected a barley and roast beef soup and a swedish meatball plate for appetizers. both came out cold. the barley was undercooked and there was no seasoning at all. no salt and pepper on the table either. meatballs were bland as well. when asked if we enjoyed it, we said no and were offered another choice of the final option, a bruschetta, which was fine.
the entre was a petite filet for me and a lobster tail for my wife. they were both tasty and cooked well, but the portion was tiny. the filet was maybe 4 oz and the lobster was just a few bites. we were not asked if we wanted more wine when our glasses were empty, and instead had to ask the waiter. also, at this point a group of guests sat at the hotel bar table directly behind us and were so loud, my wife and i could not hear each other. it stayed that way until the end.
dessert was dry and in fact my wife's was burnt. the waiter never asked again if we enjoyed our food. our champagne took two requests to receive. overall, a new years we will never forget. unfortunately.
almost $300 after drinks and tip.. way too much for the experience we had."|1.0|2022-01-06 18:55:00

the reception staff were friendly and helpful with regards to our questions about storing luggage after checkout, printing boarding passes and where to get a guiness stew. the room was small, but the beds and bedding were comfortable. the location was less than a 20 minute walk from temple bar and other attractions. for the rate we paid (300eur per night), i must say i am disappointed with the quality of the accomodations. the bathroom was not very clean (i found hairs and moths in it), and the finishings were cracked and dated (which is not problematic in and of itself, but for the rate we paid, i would expect a higher quality of furnishing). with regards to parking, the message from the hotel via booking.com recommended q-park the spire on marlborough street as having 15 eur parking for 24h, but it cost us over 30 eur. we found several cheaper options afterward, including 13 eur for 24h at the nearby jervis shopping centre car park. i recommend to update your parking recommendations.|3.5|2022-03-28 02:00:00
the food and drinks were great. pricey but it's expected from a hotel rooftoprestaurant. the hostess didn't give good vibes. she wasn't friendly but it could be because she was working on thanksgiving day. it wasn't even crowdedbusy and she couldn't let us get a bigger table for 5 people. we were cramped in a four table seating. other than her, our server and the bartender were nice and accommodating.|4.0|2021-11-26 13:13:00
"we have not been to the bedford post inn since the farmhouse closed. so when we got an email about valentines day dinner at the barn, we thought it would be nice. we sat upstairs, which is quieter than downstairs. it was also warmer as the door to the outside was downstairs and it was 16 degrees last night.
our table was a good size and the seating was comfortable. other guests were spaced in a way that we could not hear the people next to us, and hopefully they would say the same.
the menu was a six course prix- fix meal. three appetizers: hama hama oysters (3) followed by ricotta panna cotta, then foie gras. the mains (2) were bay scallops with black truffle, sun-choke, black walnut and pepper cress, and wegu steak with smoked potato, jus and mustard greens. desert was triple chocolate; dark, milk, and white raspberry.
the food was delicious and nicely presented. we were not rushed. the waitstaff was attentive, but not intrusive. it was not noisy and we could talk and hear each other with ease.
there are few good restaurants in northern westchester. we eat at crabtree kittle house regularly. when the farmhouse was open we ate there regularly as well. they had problems with the kitchen and staff in the past. i hope our experience on valentines day will be a harbinger of future quality food and enjoyable dining at the bedford post inn.
we are pleased it is back on our list."|4.0|2022-02-15 12:03:00

pompano was unfortunately awarded the worst meal of the holiday. it was very noisy. the member of a staff attending us forgot the drinks, got them wrong and then charged us for a bottle rather than a glass of wine which she changed when challenged. the food was not great, our poor mussels were overpowered by too much dijon mustard. they also had run out of caesar salad. my glass of wine was supposed to be viognier from a french vineyard but either it had been sitting in the bottle for a very long time whilst open or it was not what it said it was. it was undrinkable so i left it but was not asked what was wrong with the wine at the end. to be honest we were just glad to pay and go. we went back and had a sandwich at the hotel.|1.0|2022-02-23 23:21:00

things started out okay when we arrived and were greeted at the door by the pleasant security staff and a very sweet host from oklahoma. things went downhill a bit after that though. the drinks at lips were incredibly strong for our liking..i never got the ice or juice i requested to water it down. i will say the price of drinks was reasonable for nyc though. we didn't specify celebrating my birthday when reserving our table which would've included paying extra as we felt it unnecessary, wanting just to see the show. upon being seated, we were questioned whether we were celebrating anything and when i said my bday, our waitress quickly slapped a crown on my head. i had no idea that would entail being brought on stage, given a cupcake(with delicious icing at least!,) and a signed pic with the drag queens..then would, unbeknownst to me, be charged for each! we were expecting a $70 night for the 2 of us which ended up being an unexpected $117..though it included a 20% gratuity. our waitress wasn't terribly friendly & didn't necessarily earn that percentage for her tip, however. it's not a crazy cost for a night out..just unexpected and we already had the cost of dinner, an expensive gift from my friend, the cost of gas & tolls for her 4 hour trip down plus tolls into the city & a $500+ charge for a hotel. i just didn't appreciate the unanticipated extra charges with all our other expenses. there were some enjoyable parts and the mc was funny but i was expecting actual singing from the queens and only one actually sang while the others lipsynced. i was expecting a wilder time. it seemed a little too much of a tourist attraction for us, as well.|2.0|2021-11-16 20:40:00

mostly everything, good staff, beautiful room, lovely hotel, brilliant breakfast, spotless clean, this is a beautiful establishment. will be booking again soon, i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone . 9stars out of 10. wifi situation must be explained properly to guests. regards, patrick sheehan,cork,city monday 2324 august. room could have table bathroom could have towel rack, wifi quite complicated , it looks like you have a 24hour pass, normally when you stay in all other hotels the wifi is quiet easy to install even for old school folks like me, but the hotels wifi had too many steps to install. first nights stay i succeeded after a frustrating 30minutes attempt 2nd night it would not install. if you say to me, i should have contacted reception, i would say, when i checked in no mention of password was mentioned, secondly , when i asked for password, i should have been told it was only for 24hours, even though we were staying for 48hours. it looks to me, at check in this 24hour should be explained better , what's that very important word, yes communication..|5.0|2021-08-25 02:00:00
i really liked how unique the hotel layout felt and the size of the room was spacious. the room service option was much appreciated after a long and tiring day. the convenience of an airport shuttle made us have a worry free morning. just be sure to get two keys if you're staying with more than one person because the lights don't stay on unless your card is in the slot! i've never seen this on my travels and we were given only one card so it was inconvenient and dark if one person left.|4.5|2021-11-18 01:00:00

"stunning setting, intelligent staff.
if you want to have a relaxed enjoyable drinks, dinner or lunch without any stuffiness then go to the mitre and enjoy being spoiled by the top team.
they make every effort to give the customers an experience to remember.
the food in my opinion is delicious, my teenagers say the steak is the best they have ever tasted.
however as a wedding catering chef myself i am always wary to recommend food on any forum since the majority of people who chose to write reviews often focus on the negative and not the positive.
unforeseen circumstances are always going to occur in any kitchen, catering or hospitality industry and for me it's not so much about the food but how problems are dealt with when and if they arise.
""my steak is under cooked and inedible""

the service was slow, the food was average (my wife had stuffed shrimp that tasted like it had taco seasoning on it, i had grilled mahi that was ok, nothing special). my wife had an upset stomach all night.
to end the night i asked for a desert menu. 15 minutes mater the waitress came back and said she could not find a desert menu so she recited what she knew of off the top of her head. the dvi donuts were the best part of the evening. i felt the $148.00 bill (before tip) was high for the caliper, quantity and taste. i doubt i will do that 1 hour drive again."|2.0|2021-10-24 21:19:00

described as a 10 min walk to the beach but it's really a drive as it's on narrow roads with no footpath kitchen facilities are great. fridges provided. plenty areas to sit. a lovely teepee with a fire pit for everyone's use. best part was the staff and owner. so welcoming and helpful. thanks audrey and tommy for all your tips. stayed in june 2021|5.0|2021-06-17 01:00:00

we had a reservation at 5, and called at about 5:08 to let them know we were on our way. peter told us it would be fine. we got there at about 5:20, and were sat at a table next to a fire pit; it was in a kind of high traffic area right next to the bar. we sat for probably 10 minutes with no acknowledgement. we weren't even looked at by staff. one of us went to the bar to order our food and drinks, since she noticed others doing the same. the drinks and food didn't take long to come out, and was brought by one of the bartenders. once we already had our food we were then attended to by a server with water. the food made up for the lack of attention and service; we had the pork belly and the steak and both were perfectly cooked, the perfect temperature and flavored so well. the drinks were good as well; we ordered the frap queen and the peni-chillin. would recommend for the food and the music.|4.0|2022-02-27 23:01:00
lovely grounds, beautiful hotel and decor, room was also tastefully done(but mine was just too warm despite having the window open a lot) and spacious bathroom with fantastic water pressure! unfortunately, didn't get to check out the spa that everyone raves about. l had an unfortunate incident on my last night with a not-so-fully clothed man(i could only see so much of him through the peep-hole) banging on my door for a long time at 4.40 in the morning - he was banging at the door violently and got aggressive at a point with the door handle and it got really scary. i called the reception from the room 3 times and let it ring fully and got no answer. when the banging at the door got more aggressive and he got very loud and abusive, i had to lock myself in the toilet and ring 99 for help and the very helpful garda had to ring the hotel from their side too. the call was finally answered as soon as i tried from my mobile as advised by the garda - which i find baffling that the night staff won't respond to internal calls but answered as soon as they got an external call. after all that time, the night manager did come up and led the guy away from my door. i don't blame the hotel for the actions of the alleged wedding guest, i understand that they can't control what all the guests in their 90+ rooms do. but i fully expect the hotel to have a promptly responsive and responsible cover at all times of the day in case of emergency or when a safety issue like this occurs. what has been more disappointing is the completely lack of follow up from the hotel managers - i was checking out the morning after and told the guy at check out about what happened and he assured me that they duty manager will be in touch and that didn't happen. i called back myself later that day and spoke to the duty manager who did apologise(and offered an upgrade to the junior suite the next time i stayed there, which i refused as my call wasn't about getting any upgrades or money back but to raise a serious safety concern and get answers).|1.0|2021-10-29 02:00:00

"we really enjoyed our visit to this restaurant . we were in london for a special occasion the following day . this restaurant was near our hotel and with 50% off was good value .
we really enjoyed the food and the desert plate was very good . service was great and we liked the the restaurant decoration .
4 stars because a few meals not available , steak we asked for medium rare was served well done and they forgot one of our orders and when it came out it was much nicer with the sauce that should have accompanied our first one .
don't let this put you off though as i would definitely go back when there is an offer on as think it probably is slightly overpriced when not.

we had the crab hush puppies and blt deviled eggs apps - both were very good. we both had the salmon: mine was thick and cooked well, but my wife's portion was thin and way over-cooked. they brought out asparagus that was visibly charredscorched. the manager addressed the issue with the salmon and the staff were generally attentive. new restaurant that i'm sure will improve under this manager. not an issue with the restaurant but i would not use the complimentary valet parking service at the hotel - it was a mess and took 20 min to get our car.|3.0|2021-10-18 08:37:00
ocean social is a beachside restaurant at the eden roc hotel where you can sit outside and enjoy beautiful ocean views - for that alone it's worth it. however, its a little long in the tooth. we sat at a booth - the seat cushions were horribly stained and damp (probably from swimwear). that's uncomfortable if you dressed to come to eat there (versus wandering over from the pool). second, not one plate came without chips or missing pieces. if you cannot afford to replace damaged plates what else are you not keeping up with? the wait staff wasn't bad, but not especially attentive. twice we had to flag someone down to help us. the food itself was good. it is reasonably priced, until you pick up your car from the valet out front - that was $40 alone. we enjoyed it, but i can't say we'll hurry back. too many other places in miami beach to choose from that keep it up better.|3.0|2021-12-06 17:51:00

"location is perfect and the walk to clondalkin village was great we couldn't sleep in the room. the heating was on full blast. had to contact reception at approx 1am to get them to try and turn down the heating. i was told by the person on the phone who told me he was the manager on duty, ""i don't know what you want me to do - this is not my problem"" myself and my partner then had to ring again and request that someone come up and look at it as we genuinely could not get to sleep with the heat. a night porter then came up to the room with two portable fans and asked us to plug it in to help with the heat. he went over and checked the radiator and acknowledged it was way too hot and said he would say it to his boss in the morning. i then went down to reception the following morning to try speak to the manager about it as we paid over 100 for a room that we couldn't sleep in but unfortunately the manager wasn't in. the receptionist was lovely to speak to and took all the details of the incident down and told me that the hotel manager would be in contact with me. it has been over a month later and unfortunately i have yet to be in contact with the hotel manager about this. it's so unfortunate because the green isle has such a great reputation for being a top quality hotel."|0.5|2021-07-05 02:00:00

"the menu is very limited. my date wanted seafood, salmon, talapia, or maybe even haddock or cod, but without the lobster or shrimp. but, she is allergic to shellfish. so the only seafood she could have was the mahi tuna. it was edible, but not to her taste. the conawago inn needs more needs to gave more variety of ""just fish."|4.0|2022-02-22 21:01:00

someone told me there has been a change in management and i could definitely see that. we had been many times over the last 10 years and loved it but this time we were very disappointed. i go for the amazing cocktails, they were not amazing anymore at all, although the waiter was so nice and we got complementary drinks. the food wasn't great, not a great selection. there was no music or atmosphere. they got rid of the rooftop bar. i would go here for the cocktails and atmosphere and unfortunately that is gone now so i don't think il be picking this hotel again. the room looked newly renovated, lovely decor, comfortable bed. the first hotel i think i stayed in that had working air con. stayed in december 2020|3.0|2021-01-17 00:00:00

hi i'm just messaging in regards to friday night. i had a table booked for my friends and i at 8pm to have dinner and the security guards did not let us in and forced us to wait in line. we waited 4 hours and we did not make it in, we left at 12am hungry and upset. i tried calling you multiple times on the night and today and no one answered. the security guards were pushing us around and assaulted my friend who has a sprained ankle, they were rude and arrogant and ignored me when i attempted to speak to them. what's the point of taking bookings if no one gets priority for them? i'm really disappointed i am always at the mill for dinner and celebrations but the way we were treated on friday was disgusting|1.0|2021-10-24 21:28:00

out of towner, was close to our hotel. i had the short rib ravioli which was delicious. it included a small tenderloin steak that didn't really add to the dish. it wasn't cooked properly- was waay beyond medium rare - but the rest was good so i didn't complain. the dish was tasty without it. arugula salad was very good, hubby had pizza and it was satisfied. good service, nice wine by the glass selections. sat outside under patio heaters, nice setting. more american than italian, menu was published on internet so check before you go if you are looking for true italian fare. still a good value.|4.0|2022-02-26 12:06:00

friendly staff, neat room and nice breakfast. very noisy, all night long. rooms above the bar, where there are speakers placed outside. live band starts a set (also outside) at 11. on the other side of the building loads of noises from a very loud fan, drunk people shouting etc. on top of that: the windows did not close properly and did not provide any acoustic isolation. they make you sign a paper at check-in that states: 'you agree that you are in a nightlife area and accept that there will be noise', but they do not tell you that in person. neither is it mentioned in any of their communication. i guess this is an ideal booking if you want to go out, but not if you actually want to sleep.|2.0|2022-10-08 02:00:00

"first visit to shor restaurant in the hyatt regency hotel on waikiki beach, which overall was an excellent experience. we chose the restaurant specifically for the location and the view for the waikiki sunset. the restaurant is located on the 3rd floor of the hyatt, and using open table, we requested a balcony table which was honored through out reservation.
we expected a great view, but also received excellent service and food. the front desk was efficient and friendly, and were shown to our balcony table right on time. table service followed by a super friendly server, who watched over us the entire meal. we found all of our appetizers and entrees very good, served timely and hot as appropriate. as expected for waikiki the pricing is high, but at least service and food were well done throughout the meal.
we would consider returning again, but only for a special occasion.
hints for your visit: balcony table provides great views, but can be windy or hot at times. be aware of the ""sticker shock"" when all done with the meal."|3.0|2021-09-15 18:58:00

"the food was amazing and better than expected from a restaurant located on top of a hotel (raddison). the atmosphere was ideal for any social occasion and for private or small gatherings. recommend more chairstables (in lieu of sofacouches and coffee table for a dinner setting). all the staff was friendly and very proactive as they managed different tables (delivering dishes and taking away empty dishes). our waiter (kevin) was sociable and make the ordering process feel at ease.
we ordered two appetizers and both were excellent (gambas al ajillo + foie gras), where the wild shrimp were cooked perfectly, but the foie gras was slightly undercooked due to the watery texture inside, however, the plum added a nice touch to the dish. for the main dish, we ordered the duck breast and cod. the duck breast was cooked perfectly.
we will return again and try the tasting menu next time."|5.0|2021-11-10 17:34:00

it was my husband's birthday we were there with our children. this was a very pleasant surprise as our daughter lives near ut campus. the drag has a certain vibe and feel to it, so when we walked into the otis hotel into acre 41 it was such a feel that we did not think we were on campus anymore, we like we were in downtown austin not on guadalupe and 15th. the service was great and the food was surprisingly very delicious!! it was so cool to the restaurant actually validated valet parking for two hours at the hotel that does not happen at all in austin anymore! thank you for a great experience for my husband's birthday!|4.0|2022-01-28 05:44:00

"our expectations for a good meal, ended up with a generally disappointing experience. it stared with having to purchase table water and continued on throughout the rest of the meal.
our waitress acted like she didn't want to be there. the manager stopped by our table to check on us, his appearance was that of a slob, shirt tail hanging out, an 3 button open collar and a sport coat. not much of an image for an establishment posting high quality.
the ""jersey shore seafood platter "" consisted of 2 small shrimp, 2 medium scallops and a palm sized portion of flounder that was breaded too much and greasy. i even had to pay for tarter and cocktail sauce condiments. all this for $175,00. to sum it up.. overpriced, and very under whelmed. save your disappointment, avoid this place at all costs."|1.0|2021-10-01 00:31:00

the food was overpriced and of low quality. i could get a better burger from a street vendor for half the price. the service was par, at best. it was less of a hassle, half the price, and a better all-around experience to drive to the mcdonald's a mile away, carry the food from the parking lot to our room, and eat on the floor. i will literally never eat at legoland's restaurant again. the experience was so bad it actually diminished our otherwise amazing trip to the park. breakfast was even worse.|1.0|2022-04-05 20:19:00
restaurant downstairs, nothing else really. it wasnt as clean as we expected. for a 4 star hotel, it should be a bit more attention taken to the looks of it, even the front had spider webs all over the lampshade. same in the room, spider webs, hair (not ours), debris in the bathroom. white bed sheet had dots of bloodwine on it, which was honestly disgusting , that shouldn't be reused with that big of a stain. not the best view either, thin walls, we would hear moaning and talking in the middle of the night. we asked for a normal double bed, but we had two single beds squashed together, you could still feel a split which kept coming apart.|2.0|2022-02-15 01:00:00
breakfast time was from 7 to 9.30am. i paid 12.50 for a full irish breakfast, arrived for my meal shortly after 7.30 to be told that they had no bacon also the rest of it was not freshly cooked, was dry and had been pre cooked. just not worth the cost. 160 for room only, total rip off. prior to my visit i received an email offering the option of booking in online, which i did. when i got to reception they had no record of same. i also ordered breakfast online and no record of that either.|2.0|2022-12-10 01:00:00

(on a saturday !!) 5) 3 star food in the restaurant. not good.!! 6) all the wine in the restaurant seems to come from supervalu again not good. how is it possible for this hotel to be a 5 star hotel ??|2.0|2021-07-04 02:00:00

"took a few to get our order in for drinks and food but we finally did.
about 15-20 pass and still not one drink.
food comes out and it's all out. i mean we ordered some starters. nope not here. they're all part of the same entree.
we never even got silver ware. i had to ask for some after the food arrived.
drinks still haven't made they're way to the table. i have to ask several people why and how good comes out before a cocktail.
they forgot a part of my order and i have to ask the runner not my server cause he's absent minded and never really cared to check in on us.
they bring out the missing part of my order and then 10 minutes later bring it out again.
i got charged 2x for that part of my order.

had a great experience at the fox inn and would recommend it for regulars and visitors to the area. really strong team working there who are keen to help with food and drink selection. the back of house team are clearly very competent and produce very tasty and generous dishes. my only advice would be to improve the lighting in the garden room; doesn't need much but it does help to be able to read the menu!|4.0|2021-10-08 15:15:00

very straightforward property, well located with easy parking and airport access. i was quite surprised that for the $50 it cost us for the night, the property was so meticulously clean. i have stayed in many hotels before, and this has by far been the cleanest. everything in the room was spotlessly clean. could not have been a better value for what we got. we choose this hotel for its proximity to the airport, we only spent one night. we requested a wake up call at 4:00 am. lo and behold, 4 am on the dot, the phone rang. to which i picked up and hang up and returned to bed. they called continually until they made sure i was awake haha gotta give them 1010 on that. if it wasn't for their persistence, i would have missed my flight. can't think of anything, it was perfect for our needs.|4.0|2022-01-18 01:00:00

stayed here two nights so three meals plus breakfasts in that time. sunday roast was excellent and also their steak and ale pies worth note. some suggestion on their google feedback that the veg is undercooked. it is perfect, al dente with its taste and bite intact not soft and tasteless. this is quality locally sourced food cooked with care and skill, well presented. if you like harvester or toby that's okay but if you are looking for that special meal consider the fleece. staff are rightly proud and customer focussed. i live almost an hour away but it's worth the journey a couple of times a year at least, for the food experience and the ambiance.|5.0|2022-02-15 12:58:00

extremely displeased. my girlfriend visited boston for two nights for new year, and we thought this restaurant would be unique. we booked a week ago for a 9pm reservation on new year's eve. upon arrival, we notified the gentlemen and said, we're here for dinner under my name. he replied, saying, please speak with the hotel front desk. we talked to the front desk, and they said it's a private party, and they're not accepting additional guests. i said, why wasn't i notified our reservation was canceled? he replied it must've been an oversight and that they are sorry for the inconvenience. i don't believe he understood how rude and obnoxious it is to cancel someone's nye dinner res without notice. he didn't offer any assistance or help. to make things better everywhere else was booked. this ruined our nye, and we ended up doing nothing. worst nye ever. i will never go back here, and i hope they learn to treat the customers with respect and at least try to make amends for their mistakes.|1.0|2022-01-01 11:53:00

nothing. it made me cry (i'm not even joking). we had an extremely uncomfortable stay in the arbutus hotel. we both suffered from allergies and asthma the whole time due to dust and lack of ventilation in the room. the rooms are equipped with ancient, dusty carpets and curtains which resulted in my partner and i both suffering from blocked and bleeding sinuses the whole time that we were in killarney. there were also a bunch of dirty disgusting vents and kitchenbar exhausts outside our only window so we couldn't even open it for fresh air. the room was also far too small for a couple and the breakfast was not nice (ingredients not fresh, coffee completely burnt, bland hot options). the room was very uncomfortable and extremely unsuitable for a pregnant woman & partner. i literally cried on the first night because i couldn't breathe going to sleep. not only was outside the window disgusting with carcinogenic fumes, it looked horrendous (picture attached). not the kind of view you should get in a 4 star hotel in beautiful killarney - more like a storage room. we can't believe this is marketed as a 4 star and so ridiculously overpriced. i will be telling all my friends to avoid this place as there are many cleaner places for the same price or less. none of the staff asked at any point if my room was ok or if i had any issues with my stay, or even if everything was alright for us, so we didn't get a chance to voice our concern about the ventsair quality lack of windowsgeneral dirtiness. it's definitely not a 4 star hotel - pushing a 2 star at most but keeping 4 star prices - i feel like i have been scammed.|0.5|2021-10-28 02:00:00

great food, lovely old building. quite packed, lovely staff, quick service. only comment was the lighting was a bit dark at our table so it was difficult to see what we were eating! and the chairs weren't the most comfortable as one was quite a shallow bench and the other was a wooden chair on an uneven floor (unavoidable in an older building!), so it wasn't a place where we would sit for too long.|4.0|2022-01-24 05:17:00
"pretty easy to find, but not easy to locate entrance of the actual restaurant. had a 5:30pm reservation but arrived 20 min early, and hostess told us we had to come back later or get texted. went to the patio bar (extremely crowded), ordered appetizers+wine. hubby loved the clams, but my burrata arrived at 5:30, so lynne at the patio bar called hostess to come over to escort us to our table. hostess carried my burrata to our table but didn't look happy to do it. server was very busy, but came over quickly to take our order. i had $46 filet mignon (medium) but 14 of it was absolutely rare, so i sent it back. my plate looked very bare with only the filet and 1 cipollini onion on it. in comparison, my husband's $42 jersey shore plate was more substantial. we noticed that no bread was served, and when we asked our server about it, she said they can only bake a loaf for the table, and there was only 2 of us, so we passed on that (seriously, not even a breadstick could've been served??) we also noticed that the dining room was not full, so being told that we had to return at exactly 5:30 to be seated made no sense. sunset was in progress, so we asked for our check, and we mentioned to our server that we wanted to go outside to take a photo of the sunset and that we would be right back. she told us that it was restaurant policy that we leave an id on the table. our thought was -- what?!? she explained that they had ""problems"" in the past, so it's ""policy"". so we decided to just wait for the check (which came in 2 min flat). we are both old enough to be her parents, and i highly doubt the probability that people like us take off without paying! we could've just disappeared at any time to go the the ""restroom"" so this ""policy"" makes no sense either. we thought the food was very overpriced for what you get. so just bring your black barclay's card and you should be fine. also bring along low expectations for what you will actually receive. you won't be disappointed."|2.0|2021-09-29 14:26:00

close to the airport. only took a couple of minutes from the car park. i also booked at last minute. i booked on the tarmac as plane taxied to terminal and i was in my room about 30 minutes later. the room was oddly decorated and the furniture and fixings were outdated. it felt like i was paying for more rooms (e.g. it was a jr suite that had two bathrooms, a study and lounge and bedroom) in the room rather than a better quality of room. i would have preferred less rooms and a shower that actually had some pressure or a sofa that didn't look like it came out of a porn shoot in the 80s.|2.0|2021-11-09 01:00:00

"location, but plenty of better hotels in a similar location. the restaurant was under whelming. firstly we asked to be placed by the window as the seat we were brought to wasn't great at all, but we were told the window table was reserved (after our waiter went to check), we thought that was fair enough. but literally 5 minutes later another couple came in to be placed in a seat in front of us. they asked to be seated at the window instead and the manager said ""sure of course"". this was only one annoying thing to start our evening. i ordered the burger and chips, which was only ok and 25e? we ordered white wine, it was honestly room temperature and very overpriced.. we moved to the bar, and were told that our order would be taken in 5 minutes, 25 minutes later they took our order and we waited another 15 minutes for the drinks to arrive - not over exaggerating it was 40 minutes waiting with no drink. obviously with covid restrictions we could not order at the bar ourselves but it appeared there was only one girl making drinks for the whole bar. she was trying her best and super friendly even though she was obviously very under pressure. i understand there's teething problems with places reopening after the lockdown but when paying a lot for a hotel, dinner and drinks (prices much higher than average dublin prices which are already high), you atleast expect the service to be good. the last straw for us was that our room was piping hot! so much warmer than it was outside even with the air con on the lowest. we told the woman at reception about the room when checking out and she took the price of parking off our room. given that we spent over 400e in the hotel for our one night stay we were just so so disappointed with the poor standard."|2.0|2021-06-06 02:00:00

"we opted for the set menu at whitcomb's and overall i'd say the service and ambience was impeccable, but the quality of food was pretty poor. the waiting staff were very helpful and friendly, and the sommelier made fantastic recommendations for our wine. the restaurant itself is very attractive, although it has no toilet facilities of its own, so you have a long walk through the hotel lobby to the basement to use the toilets. the food itself was really lacking in flavour and the menu misleading, for instance my tuna tartare said it came with 'confit egg yolk' but it was just a raw egg yolk with some slimy egg white attached. everything was under-seasoned. it was nice to see one vegetable side option came with the set menu, but the main course itself was very small (just two lamb cutlets with no sauce or other food) so the main dish felt unfinisheduncoordinated. deserts were delicious however.
i would go back for cocktails at the hotel lobby bar and fab service, but wouldn't eat at the restaurant again and certainly wouldn't risk ordering from the a la carte menu considering the set menu was really lacking in taste and was still higher in price than similar restaurants."|3.0|2022-02-16 16:18:37

was expecting more from this having read all the previous reviews and seen bits from his other restaurant. some good dishes and some just ok. it looks as though the 3 course menu is better value as the 7 course are the best dishes with some fillers to make it 7. wine pairing was good and the service and knowledge were very good. if you've eaten in good quality restaurants this is ok but doesn't stand out for me. the setting feels more bistro particularly as the rest of the hotel is very nicely furnished. its not cheap, was the 7 course taster menu with wine pairing for two worth 565 for 2 ? probably not|3.0|2022-02-03 12:30:00

milo has only been open a couple of weeks, so they have a few kinks to work out. the ambience of sitting and looking out the large glass windows at the christmas tree lights on western, was totally worth it. the bar needs to get a groove, they were very slow with minimal customers. the menu is limited, which is fine for a hotel, however as a local and hoping to make this a fun meeting location of friends, a little more variety would be nice. the tenderloin steak was excellent, better then most local steakhouses and my husband loved the fried quail. i tasted his collard greens and they were superb, i think the best i have ever had. the taste of heaven kraft cocktail was definitely that !! my son enjoyed the rye cocktail. they do need to work on how to properly make a bruised dirty martini. all in all we will be back, probably many times. our server was logan and he did a great job. for a few of their delays they compensated us nicely, and i give them an a plus for customer service.|4.0|2021-12-09 02:00:00

the location, the staff. i am reluctant to criticize any hotel coming out of lockdown as it has been crucifying difficult for you. just delighted for a night out. great to see you so busy, and realise there are problems recruiting staff etc, so you're feeling your way to full opening. constructive critique: front desk undermanned. 2 people working hard, but with numbers picking up need more. the lovely lady at the temporary desk in reception is imop a great resource at front desk. restaurant staff worked so hard. give them a raise!! hotel decor etc needs a revamp. realise money prob not there now, but you're damned if you don't. overall i would recommend. get out of bed early and walk on the incredible beach within 100 yards of your room. give the hotel industry a break. book local and. we'll all benefit down the line.|3.0|2021-06-27 02:00:00

the shrimp and grits appetizer were truly award winning. the grits creamy, sauce divine and shrimp was succulent. the fresh bread was hot and airy serves perfectly with whipped butter with a touch of sweetness. the fried oysters were crispy and tasty. our waitress was friendly and well intended. unfortunately, everything else went horribly wrong. we waited a prolonged period of time and i canceled my salad because my husband and daughter had finished their appetizers and my salad had still not arrived. our entrees arrived and almost every thing was cold. my husband had salmon pontchartrain which arrived cold. my daughter had the filet which was perfect but all sides cold. i ordered the crab cakes which arrived cold as well. the food was returned. my daughter's filet and mash potatoes returned piping hot and the filet cooked perfect but the green beans remained cold and tasteless. my husband's plate returned like it had been placed in a warmer so the outside was hot and inside cold. my crab cakes were inedible as they were frozen on the inside and hot outside. my husband ate the salmon and my daughter had the filet. i returned the crab cakes and choose to have kettle chips at the hotel which tasted a great deal better than anything on the plate and i don't particularly like chips. s disappointed in the experience. perhaps it was because it was st. patrick's day or maybe march madness.i had looked forward to dining at this restaurant for weeks and unfortunately left extremely disappointed. hopefully it was a one time off and everyone else will have a great experience.|1.0|2022-03-18 02:34:00

"while our service was outstanding and the food what we have come to expect, we were a bit put off by where we were seated, it was an odd shaped booth in the corner of the dining room, making it hard to communicate with each other and while we do realize that it is the holiday season, to have our order taken, and then in less than five minutes our food served was also a bit distressing, as we were there celebrating someone's birthday. as to the noise level, in an odd shaped booth, and people celebrating, we do understand that there may be a bit more noise than on a normal wednesday lunch, but maybe next year try not to seat so many large parties around smaller groups. as a business, we understand your need to make sure you can serve as many as possible within a defined time frame, but after frequenting cedar creek for many years, this year was just not what we have come to know and love about what was once one of our trusted destinations for not only our business but our clients as well. i will recommend cedar creek, but please know it will be with a description of our experience. the good and the unpleasant.

hotel is lovely. it was our third time staying here. staff were lovely especially ciara in the bar. very lovely girl and very accommodating and attentive. hotel is lovely and clean and the family suites are the reason we always come back. great when you have kids with you as the rooms are separate. breakfast was a disaster. we were over an hour waiting on our breakfast from when we ordered. my kids were so frustrated by the time it came they wouldn't eat it. the lady serving us was lovely and apologised however she said it just wasn't coming out of the kitchen and i would effect when should have followed up rather than us following her. we had to ask 4 times before our breakfast was brought out to us and even after that they forgot my husbands breakfast and in the end we just told them leave it. the breakfasts room wasn't busy when we went down. there was only about 4 other tables so it really shouldn't have took this long. we had tayto park booked so we could have done without being so delayed with breakfast. when the breakfast did eventually turn up, it wasn't great. the poached eggs were hard and the hollandaise sauce was cold and curdled.|3.5|2021-06-30 02:00:00
the room was quite large but was very warm and because we were at the front when we opened the window there was a lot of traffic noice.. but i would have to clarify that it was probably the hottest night of the year, air-con or a fan would have been useful the room|4.0|2021-07-21 02:00:00

"my wife and i both thought che was good..not great, not bad, but solidly good. i enjoyed the lasagna. my wife's swordfish was a little dry. the service was okay, in light of this whole industry's staffing issues, but certainly not outstanding. our waiter was pleasant and busy, even thought the place was only at about 75% capacity. the room is nice; not really warm and inviting, but certainly not cheaply done. the space in dominated by a huge half-moon bar that really did not seem to be functioning as a bar, but more of overflow from the kitchen. there was no bartender there and no one interested in it a place to sit. i don't know if that was just the night we were there (which was a saturday night), but it seemed weird that this huge dominant focal point was more of an ignored space than a useful part of the restaurant. it was also odd that there was a little ""shop"" area with half-filled shelves of sauces and pre-packaged food. maybe that is because the restaurant is attached to a hotel?
overall, it was an ok place to eat with decent food, but i do not know if we are going to make it part of our regular rotation. but, then again, i wouldn't tell anyone not to go there. it was that kind of place."|4.0|2021-09-20 12:59:00

"it pains me to leave bad reviews but this place was unfortunately a total disaster. we did the ""brunch on the rooftop"" menu, which consisted of 10 ""courses"" (three of which were drinks), which came out sporadically over the course of 2 hours. we sat most of the time starving and waiting for the bite size food to come out. the waitress was nowhere to be found. when she did come to our table it was to inform us that the cocktails from the menu were sold out, and offered us some cheaper, standard options: basic mimosa or sangria. we asked for cocktails, which is what we signed up for with the menu but the waitress said they weren't allowed to provide cocktails as a substitute for the cocktails they didn't have - utterly ridiculous reasoning, totally ridiculous brunch experience, i'd be so angry if it weren't for the fact that i feel genuinely bad for this poorly run place."|1.0|2021-11-11 16:16:00

"celebrating our anniversary was our first time to dine at bob's, and we were very impressed! our server michael greeted us with a ""happy anniversary!"" we had the ny strip and the lobster tail entrees with a split wedge salad. the entrees come with a huge baked potato and a huge full carrot, and we took home leftovers of both of these. the sommelier helped us choose a pinot noir wine, which was perfect. and to end the dinner, we were served a complimentary anniversary brownie sundae customized for me by adding a caramel brulee drizzle, chocolate for my husband. the restaurant had come highly recommended by friends, and we too will highly recommend dining here as the experience was top notch!!"|5.0|2021-06-12 14:19:00

"booked for boltons bistro but were seated in bar instead (table ok though ). ambience therefore very different to previous visits in other years, and limited menu without the usual range of fish for which boltons is known.
starter was ok, as was sweet .but main course was dire. ordered fish and chips, but my fish in particular was thick with soggy batter penetrating through it , more batter than fish., and barely digestable. husbands was better and had more fish. but he was disappointed that we had dry, frozen chips , and both of us left a lot on the plate. however our waiter was too busy schmoozing hotel guests (and moaning about his pay ) that he left us with the plates for ages and then never even bothered to ask how it was despite it being obvious we hadn't enjoyed it! so i had to make a point of saying it wasn't good and he said he'd ""speak to the chef""., but offered no apology. we heard no more when he came to give us sweet menu,; he kept approaching table with mask under his nose (!) and when serving sweet nearly poked me in the eye with my plate as he served my husband first . we then had to struggle to catch his attention to get those plates cleared and ask for bill (after waiting well over 15 mins).when he presented bill to us i had to ask what the response of the chef had been at which point he burbled some rubbish about fish coming in different sizes (!! -strange i thought they were all identical ?!!), and that was why it could come out differently, and still never apologised. (we doubt he ever spoke to the chef.). nothing was taken off the bill to compensate for our poor experience and nor did they mark the fact it was booked as my husbands birthday meal in anyway.
this is our most local restaurant but will not be going there again."|1.0|2021-12-27 07:34:00

we went to 8-eleven on 1223 as they were having b1g1f entrees. we started off with cocktails. delicious, but pricey by town standards. each couple ordered a caesar salad to share. our entrees were 3 steak frites and one salmon. the steaks were all ordered medium, but arrived medium rare to rare with juices oozing much too red! also the chef was very heavy handed with the salt shaker! so much so that it really detracted from our enjoyment of the beef. no one sent their steak back as they came sliced with herb butter on top. the salmon was reported to be delicious. beluga lentils were an interesting description for petite lentils. each couple split the layered puff pastry dessert. it was deliciously sweet but difficult to eat with just a fork. cutting with only a fork caused the cream filling to exit its layers. also $10 for the dessert was on the high end price wise. for christmas eve eve, the restaurant was very crowded. it seems their promotion really drew in the crowd.|4.0|2021-12-25 15:36:00

"weirdest place i've ever been to. okay, so i'm looking for the restaurantbar. no outside sign to point out the direction, but i see a sandwich board with it looking like it's inside the hotel lobby. i go inside and no interior sign, but an open room with a pool table, and some guys playing. i think maybe that's the direction, so i walk past the table, right into what looks like a converted store front. i'm looking for a host stand, but only see a sign on the corner of the bar stating that pickup is done there. i'm standing, looking around, and while the bartender looks busy, and most of the low tables are full, or look like they're in use, the server walks out from the back, sees me, and continues to a table to serve them. i wait a bit more, but they move off to clean a hi-top. so i think maybe i seat myself? i wander farther in, the server and bartender look at me, but say nothing. i'm getting a bit confused, as i'm wondering who's going to take my vaccine status and id. none of the lower tables that seem vacant are clean, and the one clean hi-top can't be used by my due to a medical handicap. so i take one more look around, still no greeting or verbal inquiry from the staff, and i decided that i guess my reservation was not valid or perhaps pointless, and i leave.
i don't know why i was ignored, nor am i positive that i was even in the correct spot, as zero signage. clear signage, a clear demarcation of entrance area to the seating area, and being clearly acknowledged upon entrance would help people know if they were in the right spot. too bad that i didn't get to try the food. it looked interesting. disappointing."|1.0|2022-03-12 09:09:00

"arrived at the hotel opted for late check out as we were in tullamore for an appointment in the late afternoon the following day this was an additional 25 for 2 hours, reception were not very welcoming, the hotel was much smaller than the photos , room was small and basic had no air conditioning or fan available and unfortunately for us it was 28 there were no bottles of water in the room , no coffee tea facilities or mini fridge , my husband contacted reception as i am heavily pregnant to see if a fan could be arranged they said they would check and come back to us , 2 hours later we still hadn't heard back which was quite frustrating and the reception phone had a constant busy tone so we called back from our mobiles and hit the reservation option and asked to be moved room. they did move us room which we greatly appreciated and we're delighted about. unfortunately when we got to the room we went out to the balcony to cool down , i sat on a chair which was so rusted the leg was broken and completely snapped as soon as i sat luckily my husband caught me as i fell so we avoided a serious accident. when we brought this to the hotel manager it was dealt with quite poorly with just a ""sorry about that"" response. we paid a late checkout fee and left quite annoyed, i was sat outside waiting on my husband to get the car when the manager came outside and offered to refund the 25 late check out fee which we availed of however i work in higher management myself and would of dealt with a situation like that alot differently given the fact i could of been extremely hurt by the broken chair that should of been checked before the room was rented out. i stay in hotels weekly for work and have never had such a poor experience."|1.0|2021-08-10 02:00:00

"pros: nice location. hotel interior well-designed and modern. free parking. cons:management- throwing people under the bus for lack of leadership/oversight. bait and switch - job descriptions doesn't match the job, there's no payroll, ar/ap work or any real opportunity to learn accounting/build skills. training opportunities offered/promised during the interview quickly evaporate - be real careful about this one because the carrot can get dangled for months. high medical cost- employee cost as much as other places covering a family. no pto - ""accruing pto"" means no pto for at least a year. no holiday pay - there are all kinds of caveats with this one (only after a certain number of months, for certain employees, and whether or not you take a day off before/after a holiday) and it usually pans out to no holiday pay at the end. don't treat employees like a charity case after they ask to make up hours or offer money out of your own pocket on an if-then basis of whether or not they really need it. job postings or job descriptions should match the job for the most part."|1.0|2022-11-05 16:58:00
very nice for families, spacious, plenty of channels on tv. extremely good vitality breakfast, plenty of parking both in the garage and outside the hotel. great free service to the airport with park and fly option. also, the carpets and beds are extremely comfortable there was a bunch of unaccompanied minors with no masks, running around and shouting in a foreign language, running in and out of elevators, bumping into people while all of us were trying to social distance.. all in all stay was really great and i will stay there again..it'd just be nice if someone could enforce the rule of no unaccompanied minors around and send them back to their rooms.|4.5|2021-12-15 01:00:00

there was a considerable amount of noise on the 4th floor up to c.4am. this noise woke me repeatedly. not good when you have a busy day following. the culprits were not working next day and this raises the question as to why they were allowed to stay there at all. i raised this significant issue with staff but there was no meaningful response. stayed in february 2021|1.5|2021-02-15 00:00:00

our only 'grown' is that dog owners attending seem to feel its ok to let you dog 'sit at the table'.. not everyone wants to be surrounded by dogs at dinner time. i appreciate dogs seem to be the new 'kids' and are part of the family, don't get me wrong we have a child and like dogs but certainly wouldn't ever allow our dog to eat at a table. id hope as an establishment you can advise customers to not allow this, i dont want to sit where a dog has sat then eat!! obvs this is down to owners not thinking about anyone else."|4.0|2022-02-09 06:41:00

"this is a run of the mill asian inspired resturant. the tables are crammed together, the music blares so conversation is a lost art. the resturant depends solely
on qr ciode menus, that encourage everyone to grab their phones, find the menu and then since you need it multiple times leave it on the table where the temptation
to look at it and make it part of the night's social interaction sad
food is family style for the most part and nothing really special. the duck is ok, but mott 32 and 5 other asian stye restaurants in town fit that bill better. lobster noodles are short on the lobster and void of any real taste.
if you are staying at the resort (if you can really call this convention style casino hotel a resort) it might be a good choice after you sample everything else.
on the buzzer scale this one is one long buzz (sorry wrong answer)."|3.0|2021-11-21 20:06:00

nothing i didn't like about the place! absolutely everything. i went there with my husband and the only problem was that i didn't book 2 nights. the cabin is decorated so beautifully and has all the essentials you would forget to pack for a night of glancing from oil salt and pepper to the complimentary bottle of prosecco and fry breakfast left for you in the fridge. and that view of the lake was absolutely spectacular. we didn't get to bbq which was filled with charcoal ready to use but we made some use of the hittub which was amazing. so a treat!! cannot wait to stay here again!! one of the best places i've ever stayed. so impressed stayed in march 2021|5.0|2021-03-30 01:00:00

the carvery chef on the sunday was lovely. he really was the only notable member of staff from our stay. the food was also lovely in fairness. the room was admittedly cheaper than expected the service in the bar 812022 was brutal. young staff that just lacked direction and experience. one of four tables in the bar, left waiting for a beverage order, and had to go up to the bar to re-order. it was like we had made staff go out of their way when we got the order then..no thank you or anything..just dropped at the table and walked away. the room itself was also very dated. the hotel and staff all just seemed a little tired and dated. couldn't fault the food, but the service wasn't very welcoming, and the service wasn't up to scratch. have attached images of room also..check in and check out was also very cold and uninviting. all in all, the trip was such a let down and a disappointment. the carvery chef is the only staff member that saved this review somewhat. definitely in no way will we be returning.|2.0|2022-01-09 01:00:00

hotel is close to airport and has 24 hour shuttle bus service. there is a 5e fee for run to airport, but pickup from airport to hotel is free. bus runs about every 20-30 minutes with no actual times posted. pickup and drop off is at bus platform 16 near terminal 1. hotel is modern with nice lobby and 3 different places to eat in the hotel. we ate at the italian kitchen and the food was good, hot and plentiful. recommend it. registration desk could not find our reservation. also, when i tried several times to check-in online as they requested, the online service could not find my reservation. seems my booking.com name is not the same as my actual name and they had me under my booking nickname. surprised that even with the confirmation number and the hotel reservation numbers they could not easily find it. eventually did find it. there was little cold water on the 4th floor. we had hot water but not much cold water. strange, it's usually the other way around isn't it ?|4.5|2022-06-06 02:00:00

we were able to sit in the back patio which was very comfortable. our server, holly, was cheerful and attentive to our needs. we appreciate that the staff was masked and that we were able to sit apart from other diners and that there were strong air conditioners that facilitated strong air flow. all of our concerns during this time when the virus is still prevalent were met and made us feel very comfortable. the cesar salad which two of us had and the blt sandwich which another member of our party had were delicious.|5.0|2021-09-15 05:46:00

staff were very friendly and helpful. room and bed were very comfortable, leisure complex was so relaxing. the viking tours boat leaves from the pier just outside the hotel and a round trip to athlone town was 15, this trip was fantastic. although the location was very peaceful, there wasn't much you could do in the area apart from the aqua park and a short walk further down the road. it is approx. 20 each way between the hotel and the town so it's something to factor in, if you're not using the boat.|4.5|2022-10-15 02:00:00

i liked everything about the property! it was an amazing location and centra being directly across the road from it was just exceptional. the restaurantbar was gorgeous, interior was beautiful and the hotel was so clean! the bed in the room was amazing, the room was fantastic and the shower was lovely. the shower was hot the minute you turned it on. there was a fan in the room which was a great touch as the room did get warm with the heating on. the travel cot we had for the baby was perfect, she slept like a log! the food wasn't great for breakfast but everything for a 10er where could you go wrong!! in saying that, i left nothing on my plate. the girls at reception were extremely helpful and so lovely! i will definitely be recommending this hotel to a friend. the only thing i didn't like about the property was the fact that the car park was full when we got there and we had to across to the centra to park the car in the rain and we had the baby with us. apart from that, it was perfect.|5.0|2022-02-13 01:00:00

no response from the hotel after the complaint i made. i normal would not complain about anything but i would like to express how my recent stay in your bonnington hotelmcgettigan's bar went on saturday- sunday under the name danielle kenny( 3 rooms of 3 people). upon arrival we were checked in by cristen (i think was his name) i think i should mention him first as he was a pleasure to deal with and is honestly the only thing good about our stay there. he gave us such a good check in and provided us with support from went we checked in and even well after our check out as i forgot my earphones and he went and got them for me and kept them for me to collect the follow day. 5 star for him! as the resident bar isn't open, i got a bottle of beer at the centra beside to drink while getting ready and was assured i could get it opened in the bar and take to my room. a young gentleman took the bottle no problem to go to open it behind the bar and i would have been on my way back upstairs. until i guess is the bar manager sent him back and his shouting at him that's not allowed that's not allowed. i'm sorry i'm not allowed to have a drink in a room i'm paying 150+ for? he forced the young man to come back to me in shame he hung his head, i felt so bad for him. if the man had an issue with this, he should have addressed it himself not send a young boy to do his dirty work! i would have kicked off, only i felt bad for the young waiter. (i apologise to him if i got him in trouble) we then booked 2 tables in mcgettigan's through the hotel and were told the 2 tables would be beside each other, but we were not really expecting that as its saturday and busy. we then met at mcgettigan's floor by joe, and by god we nearly left straight away. reception staff stayed in december 2020|0.5|2021-01-04 00:00:00

room was excellent , comfortable bed, breakfast was good quality and variety location was very central to the city so walking was no issue and a good way to see the city and what it has to offer. the in room hospitality could have been more generous, did have to ask each day for replenishments.|4.5|2022-01-09 01:00:00
the loud piercing alarm at around 7.30am on a sunday morning. the receptionist acted like this was nothing unusual. all guests were woken up and headed outside. i was much more tired than i should have been for the rest of the day. location, nice room, i was given a double although i had booked a single, the receptionist, a man, told me, a woman, that the double room status did not mean i had permission to bring someone back at night! as if i didn't know. i've stayed in many hotels and more often than not single translates into double but never once was i told: do not bring someone to your room at night now! it's not something i would do, it would be in breach of the contract of booking and i really don't need to be told this. apart from that a smoke alarm went off in someone's room around 7.30am, and a piercing alarm sounded throughout the entire hotel, in each and every room. most guests headed outside. i was shaken and cold and really disappointed as my sleep is patchy enough. stayed in december 2020|2.0|2021-01-05 00:00:00

"disappointing - we went for a birthday which i had stated in my booking and upon arrival - yet not one staff member acknowledged the birthday girl at all. after one week of ringing i was not once ever able to get through to the actual restaurant and therefore had to confirm my booking with hotel staff.
restaurant manager (male) was extremely confrontational unnecessarily and failed to acknowledge my suggestions around better communication. some staff were polite however seemed uncomfortable with their managers behaviour however they too failed to acknowledge the birthday girl or step in when the manager continued to be confrontational.
food is ok. drinkswine options i found limiting.
venue is beautiful and location lovely. hotel staff were helpful and very polite."|3.0|2021-09-09 16:39:00

on open table the bookings showed availability till 9.30am, however when we called the restaurant they said it must be a mistake as their breakfast ends by 9.30am, so we had to convince them to keep the buffet open for us. when we reached there, it was a regular buffet breakfast and not the a la carte which shows up when you book via open table, looks like there is a communication problem with the restaurant and open table. the food was good but not the experience i was hoping for.|3.0|2021-10-10 12:03:00

if you're looking for any resemblance to the comus inn of the past, you're out of luck. we were there with our family on an early (5:30) saturday evening. we were met with a packed parking lot due to a private function we knew nothing about. no chance to view the sunset, the beautiful back lawn was full of people, bonfires, and a cheesy band. the inside of the comus was noisy and chaotic and the lighting was like a cross between a warehouse and a truck stop. a door to the outside was left open, i guess to give the people outside easier access to the bar, and we were freezing the whole time. the wait staff were very friendly and tried to be helpful but were completely overwhelmed trying to serve both the private function outside and the restaurant patrons inside (our server doubled as the bartender). pizza is featured prominently on the menu but we were told they were out of dough. the food we ordered was mediocre at best. my daughter and i had the specials: salmon and beef tenderloin respectively. she enjoyed her salmon, my beef was just okay. all around i'd say the newly renovated comus inn is a great disappointment.|1.0|2021-11-08 08:19:00

breakfast and other dining options were very good. despite covis restrictions the bar was also very good. not having the facility to charge dining and drinks to your room was very annoying. not helped by the fact that the technology used for card payments was pretty awful and often did not work which meant going to the atm for cash.|4.0|2021-07-12 02:00:00

the reservations are hard to secure but once you do, it is definitely worth the wait. the food exceeded our expectations. for the two of us, we shared a bottle of wine plus two goat fashioned cocktails, the pork belly salad (our favorite), chickpea fritters (5 really small square pieces like the size of a hotel pillow mint), lamb sirloin skewer, and goat curry with masa chips (our second favorite). the ambience is elegant and the service top notch. we can't wait to return.|5.0|2021-12-13 07:25:00

"we made nye reservations at the rooftop. they kept us waiting 30 minutes in the lobby before being able to go upstairs, in the meantime they served warm rose in plastic cups. once we got upstairs, and waited some more, we were finally able to sit. it took them about 45 minutes to take our order and we didn't start eating our appetizer until past midnight.. mind you we were there for a 10:30pm reservation. the first course arrived about 30 minutes after the appetizers and at around 1:15am they brought the main course and the dessert at the same time and the check and had the audacity to say ""no rush."" when they were already turning on the lights and making it apparent they wanted us to leave. the food was really good but kind of cold and small portions, we expected small for a ""quick"" pre-fixe nye dinner but not really cold.. a few servers and bussers didn't give a damn about their masks and neither did the bartenders, neither our proof of vaccination or id were requested at any moment so happy omicron to us, lol. furthermore, the rooftop looks nice in photos but it is actually quite a narrow strip in the back of the hotel, the drinks were dreadful and we were initially seated in a corner without views and we asked for another table with slightly better views.. so be mindful that even if you book this for the views you might not even get them. i've worked at restaurants all my life and we did many events and pre-fixes and they're usually pretty straight forward and easy to do if the team is organized, so the very lousy service was surprising. we ended up leaving at around 1:30am.. right after finishing our dessert and just about 3h past our reservation time. in total, we spent about 30 minutes eating and 2.5h waiting. we ended feeling exhausted by the whole waiting thing and drunk on the cheap wine and dreadful cocktails they served, alas the headache the morning after was better than the experience of dining here. 1010 would not recommend."|1.0|2022-01-02 01:15:00

our first dining experience at victoria's for a valentine's day lunch that will not be our last for sure. outstanding meal that was matched by equally outstanding service and ambiance. we started with a cocktail for my wife pam that was prepared by our waitress whose name i cannot recall absent the bartender that was excellent, and for me an equally excellent california viognier from their first-rate wine menu. we started with a very tasty shrimp appetizer. pam had the seafood special which was a wonderfully prepared and presented halibut. my crabcake was its equal with lots of lump crabmeat. the entry to the restaurant through the lobby of the appropriately named boardwalk hotel facing the atlantic was an experience in and of itself with the sounds and sights of parakeets and parrots and turn of the century charm. we can understand why both the hotel and restaurant are so highly rated.|5.0|2022-02-20 19:09:00

"mattress comfortable, but i do prefer a mattress cover rather than the sheet only shower leaked badly onto floor. every time we had a shower. we reported it to the desk, who were shocked, and said they'd send a workman up to fix it. a workman did show up, and apparently fixed it. unfortunately, the leak was as bad as ever. the workman also left debris in the shower, instead of brushing it up. this was not pleasant when standing on this rubble. an inspection of the bottom of the bathroom door, revealed old damp stains, and very badly worn woodwork. it was obvious this was an ongoing problem, which had never been corrected. i could see this once very good hotel, had become ""tired"" and needs a lot of refurbishment. around the jacuzzi in the pool area, tiles were missing. very poor."|1.0|2022-10-30 02:00:00

the hotel is modern and well set out. our room was a bit small, but comfortable, and at only 55 a night i can't complain. service in the bar area was a bit slow and this is exacerbated due to covid-19 as you are prevented from ordering at the bar. still i think a few more waiting staff could have solved this problem especially as the bar was busy after 6 pm. as for dinner the food and wine was good and apart from an incident where the waitress (accidentally) set a napkin on fire, fairly uneventful. but again that problem with service raised its ugly head and the time lag between our starter and main course was a bit long. we also ordered tea and coffee to finish but it failed to materialise (no explanation given) so we gave up and just paid our bill.|4.0|2021-06-27 13:04:00

service was slow and the very loud 70's disco music was totally inappropriate for the setting and the wished-for relaxed evening meal.

it was very cold in the restaurant with cold air blowing directly on my face and food. this was extremely uncomfortable and caused my food to get cold quickly. i was shivering throughout the night and i even had a shawl around my shoulders. the service was slow considering the restaurant wasn't busy. however, our server was knowledgeable on wine selections. we weren't familiar with high altitude wines and discussed what we like and she suggested a wine that was very good. i ordered the shrimp with polenta. the shrimp was very good, but the polenta was extremely salty. i wasn't able to eat it. my husband ordered the flat iron steak and it was excellent. it was cooked perfectly and the sauce was very tasty. i ordered the lamb meatballs for an appetizer and those were very good. for a restaurant that's not busy and at this price range, the service should have been much better. there are a lot of excellent high-end restaurants in charlotte, so we probably won't come back. we're foodies and eat out a lot. we were really looking forward to dining here.|3.0|2021-08-20 12:40:00

despite being more than 8 open tables outside, they would not let us sit there or barside rail. we went inside to our table with our drinks and jackie immediately greeted us. she's great btw! we ordered burrata salad for app, it was ok, very tiny for $13. my gf got the scallops & i got order of wings with spicythai chili mixed sauce. the wings were the worst things i've ever had at deauville (small, dry, flavorless), until i tasted one of the scallops, which was clearly not fresh. they were rubber. pure rubber, i couldn't even eat it. for over $100 we had a miserable experience for the value. aside from a really hard working server, one of the worst experiences down the shore ever. we won't eat here again (full-timers) and will ensure to tell all of our neighbors and friends to spend their time elsewhere. again, for the $$ you charge serve fresh food, that's cooked the way it's presented on menu and ordered by patrons. this was terrible!|1.0|2021-05-28 14:26:00

comus inn ruined their charm. they remodeled the place and put in loads of bright lights. they also took away the white tablecloths and skinnied back the menu. my advice, lower the light level several hundred watts, create a more extensive menu and bring back white tablecloth dining. anyone looking for a first class dinner and experience should avoid comus inn|2.0|2022-02-06 07:12:35

"the drinks and the patio were great. the food was very amateurish and bad. like something your college roommate would put together. some basic concepts of italian food are, don't mix seafood and cheese and don't mix sweet and savory. that said i thought the menu was very bizarre . i chose the bucatini cacio e pepe. ( bucatini with pecorino cheese and pepper). it ordinarily came with poached mussels, which, for the reason i stated above, i told them to omit. what came was pasta with a vaguely sweet coating, pepper and no cheese. how can you call it cacio e peppe, if there is no cacio? and the sweetness? did they put sugar in the pasta water instead of salt?
my partners linguine with limoncello garlic and whitefish was equally bizarre."|2.0|2022-04-10 20:26:00

this is a tough review to write. this was our first visit to this restaurant. the food was excellent. the patio is comfortable and has an amazing view of the beach. however, their wine list is small. and, the first bottle we chose they didn't have (and we didn't find out until our salads had already been delivered). the second bottle we chose, the waiter came back sheepishly to say that they were still looking for it and had sent someone downstairs. then he came back and said they found it, but it wasn't chilled, so they had put it on ice. by then, we had finished our salads and still had only water to drink. we settled on a wine he assured us they had, which was promptly delivered. but then we waited 30-minutes for our entrees to be delivered. during that time, they offered bread (doesn't that normally come with the salads?), and the waiter said he would offer complimentary desserts. by the time we finished our entrees, we turned down the desserts because we had come there to see a singer who was performing in their bar. but, because we were just diners, and not staying at the hotel, we were only permitted to get in the long line to get in to the bar and we ultimately didn't see the artist we came to see. they did offer us a discount on our meal. i'm not sure if we'll go back. the food was really good, but the experience was lacking.|4.0|2021-06-13 20:35:00

the service was terrible which is incredibly disappointing. i had booked 2 months in advance for my birthday lunch, when arriving we were told we had 10 minutes to order otherwise the kitchen was closing- if this was the case i should have been told this when i had booked and i would have booked an earlier table. we had booked for sunday lunch to be told the sunday roast was not available and my friend had been brought the wrong meal twice. the lady that served us was incredibly rude from start to finish and tutted and rolled her eyes after bringing the wrong dish the second time. lastly we were told we had to leave without even being given the bill because she needed the table back. it would have been nice to be given some warning possibly 20 minutes instead of 5 minutes. the food was good however the service was awful and for what was meant to be a special birthday meal was ruined by the service of your staff.|2.0|2021-09-27 11:40:00

we loved our visit to glen rock mill inn. they were able to accommodate a change in our reservation with no problem. the room we were seated in was very rustic and comfortable right by a fireplace and the bar. we had the mill manhattan, a feature drink and old fashioned and martinis which were all very good. we decided to take advantage of the prix fixe menu that includes an appetizer entree and dessert. our party had the chicken cordon blue, short ribs and the special halibut. everything was delicious! the chicken and beef were served with the most interesting brussels sprouts and we couldn't get enough. our dessert were the lemon raspberry cake, pineapple upside down cheesecake and the smith island cake and all of them were great. the wines were good as well. would love to return when we're able to eat outdoors. weather did not cooperate.|5.0|2021-07-04 18:45:00

friendly helpful bar and serving staff. we were not given breakfast times at check in and when we went down the next morning at 10:12 am we were told that breakfast was finished. tile on the bathroom floor was badly cracked and lifted causing me to cut my toe on it. one of the windows in the room was absolutely filthy dirty. the window was able to open in so it could be easily cleaned. the curtain on that window was closed when we first arrived and the next morning when i opened the curtain to admire the beautiful views i was shocked at how dirty the glass was. i brought all of these issues to the attention of the girl on reception when i was checking out. she didn't ask how our stay was or if everything was ok. i politely explained how we had missed breakfast and that she had not told us the times and she answered that she only works there at weekends. also i found it a little strange that the bible was on the bedside locker. in such a diverse world we live in i'm not quite sure if this is the right place for the bible. i was disappointed with my visit to the hotel this time but i could not fault the bar and serving staff as they where friendly and polite when we had our evening meal and drinks the food was very tasty. let's hope it will be a better experience next time as i have enjoyed many good nights at this hotel in the past.|3.0|2022-06-18 02:00:00

"our family had dinner twice during a stay in southern californian. at our first dinner, the restaurant was out of chips, shrimp, and all salads of any form. service was descent but never saw the manager to apologize or explain anything. when asked to put the check on the hotel bill, it required the manger and he was ""busy"" and we were asked to wait about 5 minutes until he could come to our table. during our second visit, the food was available but the service was spotty with our waitress disappearing for long periods of time. although there are plenty of people on the floor working on the restaurant, the service is not great. in general i would say the food is very good, the ambiance and decor are excellent. i just don't think the management cares that much about service or customer's experience. it is almost the feeling you get in a club; ""just be glad you are here and we get to you when we get to you""."|4.0|2022-02-22 20:05:00

everything about this restaurant is marvelous!
christophe is an outstanding waiter that ensured our evening was delightful! the chef is creative and quite obviously has the magic touch to create memorable and delicious recipes. my husband had the bone in steak, cooked to perfection with just the right amount of seasoning to add to the flavor without overpowering the delicious cut of beef. i had the duck confit, which was cooked equally to perfection, moist and rich with flavor.
the ambience is perfect! quiet without being dull. the bar area is visible from the dining area, however the acoustics keep it from getting noisy. every suggestion christophe made felt catered to my specific tastes. i'll have to return to la specifically to eat and this enjoyable establishment and stay in the fairmont hotel- which is also a treat with surprises at every corner."|5.0|2021-12-20 07:38:00

breakfast was not great. i am vegan. there was oat milk but no non dairy butterspread which is widely available. i ordered a vegetarian breakfast and it was very basic. for a hotel as expensive as this 199 for one night, i think they could have stretched to beans and a vegetarian sausage. i was asked if i wanted toast. i said yes and it was put on my table immediately while i was getting cereal so was cold before i got back to the table. breakfast|3.0|2022-08-07 02:00:00

great location for touring. beautiful lobby area. mikey was an awesome bartender, made us feel very welcome! was great to have a shower and bath in the bathrooms. rooms were spacious and comfortable. lots of clothes storage. we requested a fan because of the hot weather and we were given one. when we arrived we had to wait on a delivery of bath towels, not the hotel's fault but was inconvenient. not much of a view from the room. i wasn't impressed at all with the food in the restaurant but my partner enjoyed his meal. thought the restaurant area was very dark and drab though, bit of a depressing atmosphere. no teacoffee making facilities in the room so my partner had to go out for coffee each morning. again, not the hotel's fault but on our first night the guests in the room next door to us were yelling and screaming very late in the night.|4.0|2021-07-28 02:00:00

"it was our wedding anniversary and first trip to london with our 5 year old. i had pre booked some restaurants but not this one. it was a bit of a dummy run for a big weekend planned for the spring to see how our little one would cope with crowds,walking and a hectic schedule. all booked last minute so getting into restaurants was not easy.
we failed epically on most things that day!! by the time we got to covent garden she was tiredhungry and just about done! i booked on line 45 mins before we arrived for the only reservation i could get that afternoon for an outside table. our reservation was at 5pm. we arrived at 4.15 and the hostess was simply amazing! not only did she squeeze us in, but got us a lovely table inside with a plenty of room for madame to curl up in our coats whilst we had a fabulous meal to celebrate our anniversary!
the food was outstandingservice impeccable and the staff were so understanding! i took my main course home in a takeout bag and ate it at the hotel but that was so not their fault! it was to stop the monumental meltdown that was about to occur!
hands down one of my most enjoyable moments of the weekend! the ceviche and oysters were perfect!! xx"|5.0|2021-10-11 10:45:00
awful extremely overpriced food. we were ripped off by this misled nice modern establishment. we stayed at hyatt regency. the first night, we had our dinner at shor, within the hotel where we stayed, it was ok. the next night we would drive 12 miles away from clearwater beach and had a wonderful, out of this world dinner at bascom's chop house. tonight, we had a dinner here at ocean hai. it was an insulted for an asian fusion restaurant. they charged $5 for a small size of plain white rice that was not fully cooked. mind you, they proud to call themselves asian fusion, and heavy on the sushi expertise. however, they can't even cook the rice right. the sushi was as if you bought them from a grocery store. the rice in the sushi was hard and again not fully cooked and tasteless. the crab rangoon was like thaw off from a frozen box that you can get from cosco. the miso soup was so salty that i have to add water from my glass to dilute it so i can eat it, so i wouldn't waste it. the meatballs were extremely salty and had a weird after taste to it. i could not even eat my sushi and asked for a to go box and only to throw them away later. our bill was $115 ( they decided to included 18% tip by themselves) sadly, we pretended that everything was fine when they asked us if everything was ok. the ambience was nice and the service was fine. but the food was inedible. as if there were some immature chefs back there trying to hard to make it better. i really wanted to ask the waiter who was actually was in charge in the kitchen, because this chef still have a long way to go..i'm an asian and my husband is caucasian american, we do know a good asian fusion prepared dishes. we don't mind to pay for a good meal but this place was really a big disappointment!!|1.0|2021-04-10 07:07:00

"this was our 2nd visit to rosalie; this time with another couple. the food was quite good but the service was very poor. perhaps our server was inexperienced, perhaps the restaurant was short staffed but the service seriously detracted from the meal. the server was clearly intimidated by the ""chef"". when one of our party requested some other greens be used in place of the frisee on her beet salad, the server said he had to check with ""chef"" even though other salads on the menu listed baby greens and were thus readily available. when ""chef"" becomes a celebrity and opens his destination restaurant he can be as much of a prima donna as he wants, but as long as he is working in a hotel restaurant in the suburbs he needs to be more accommodating.
another problem is that we wished to order wine but asked for some guidance on finding a choice compatible with our meals. the server said he would get the sommelier to help us, but when heshe never came to our table and we had already finished our starters i reminded the server we wanted to get the sommelier's guidance in choosing between 3 different varietals. after several more minutes the server said the sommelier wasn't coming over to our table but instead sent a message in favor of one of the wines we were considering.
i hope rosalie succeeds but they better get their act together."|2.0|2021-07-04 19:32:00

the room was terribly and insufferably warm. the radiator was turned up full blast and no matter how much i tried to turn it off, it wouldn't. i couldn't sleep at all, i felt like i was in a sauna. i had to open the window and lie on the floor using the duvet as a mattress to try and cool down. this is ridiculous because i live in milan and during the summer, it's more comfortable. this is the month of january and i have never been so warm. i had to catch a flight very early for essential work and i was completely and utterly exhausted because i did not get a good night sleep. nice staff. stayed in january 2021|1.5|2021-01-11 00:00:00

yeh, this place is nice, a really cozy old pub. the food is great, i really enjoyed my meal. however the style of service is a mistake, nothing was recorded when we ordered our meal. multiple things where forgotten and as we were not asked if our meal was ok, we did not have a chance to ask for the missed items. my partner ordered sausages and asked for mustard which was forgotten, he also ordered ice cream with his desert and it was served with custard. shame everything else was quite nice but disappointed about the style of service. when we visited it was not very busy. i think this way of ordering is going to be a real mistake at busy times.|4.0|2021-12-31 11:47:00

very nice hotel, great location, bed was huge and very comfortable. jacuzzi bath in the bathroom was lovely. staff were very helpful. the breakfast was great! fancy restaurant and also a separate barrestaurant so there were good options for food and drink, especially during covid. walking distance to bars, restaurants and the main shopping street. there is parking across the road in a busy car park in which you need to pay for tickets in the machine and ensure you have up to the required time. it didn't inconvenience us too much as only there for 2 nights but might be annoying for some. the hotel will subsidise some of the parking if you bring your tickets to the reception.|4.5|2021-09-01 02:00:00
"upon arrival place was barren . we asked to sit side by side in a booth .we were told no . one in booth seat the other chair across as they wanted it preserve that for when more couples came . when we left an hour and a half later ,the place was maybe a third full , and where we at it was as though we had a quarter of the place to ourselves . when you're a relatively new establishment, you accommodate as much and as often as you can.
the oysters and ceviche appetizers were fabulous . the mexican style fried rice with lobster undeniably tasty .
but ! we ordered an entree that was $55 . and the description boldly stated "" boneless"" branzino ! omg !!
""boneless"" ? ""boneless""! don't talk the talk , if you can't walk the walk ! every forkful i was pulling numerous bones out of my mouth . i know ordinarily branzino is presented as whole ,& it's billed as such . don't present a preparation style ,and do not even close to do that . and as veggie side we ordered their offering of artichoke. i couldn't help, but imagine gordon ramsay imploding at how distasteful and inept that was .
crazy shame , as beforehand looking at the hotel , this restaurant and its rooftop spot , we ahead of time imagined coming back for the rooftop restaurant & lounge . no way !"|2.0|2021-06-20 22:12:00

this is the best thanksgiving meal i've ever experienced. i love their dinners altogether, much superior to their lunches or brunches. farm-to-table fresh, innovative cooking. i've never tasted such unique, well prepared, and seasoned veggies, especially in westchester county. no extra fats, no heavy gravy, the chestnut stuffing consisted of real chestnuts, not seasoned breadcrumbs. enjoying the salad appetizer, i encountered unusual veggies. the salad dressing did not overwhelm the vegies and was but delicious. the hot rolls were all homemade. the price was reasonable. i am totally impressed. and the service was attentive but not intrusive. bravo to the chef and the staff.|5.0|2021-11-26 14:34:00

beautiful hotel, view of gap of dunloe out of this world. evening meal absolutely stunning. some minor improvements such as bar service (waited 25 minutes for a drink), plus if offering selection of bread at dinner, don't just give rolls from breakfast time, warm them up. small things but it is a 5 star hotel, otherwise really fantastic hotel|5.0|2021-06-07 02:00:00

we dined outside which was a nice atmosphere so i can't speak of the noise level. our waiter was friendly but new nothing of prices, specials and told us not to ask for anything special as the chefs were not accommodating to anything other than what the menu said. however they did give me veggies instead of fries. my friend said the lobster dumplings were delicious but her fish entree was good not great. i ordered steak medium well. it came rare. i sent it back. waited and i don't think they asked any fire to it. it was still red and rare. ! i said i can't eat steak rare like that and waiter took it off the bill . one entree and one app was $60. no drinks no dessert. the three women next to us said two of their entrees were cold and sent back. they were not happy either. we were going to eat their two nights in a row as we wanted to have outdoor covered area due to rain and not eating indoors due to covid ..but opted to take out somewhere else and eat in the hotel. menu sounded good but too many issues. the bristle sprouts they gave me though w the steak were very tasty.|2.0|2021-10-16 19:31:00

we went for fathers day. reservations were at 5:30, were seated quickly, but were in the back part of the restaurant and it was super hot as the sun was setting. after our food was delivered and server came to check i did say something and they immediately put some sun shades up outside but it was really uncomfortable. food was just ok. we eat steaks at home and husband didn't want to cook on his day but we weren't impressed w the quality of food presented. it was overpriced. service was good and drinks were good too. was disappointed towards the end service started slowing down (empty water glasses not filled) when they started getting busy. nice setting but most likely won't be back.|2.0|2021-06-21 20:14:00

we had horrible service and an incompetent waitress. she told us we can't split checks because it's too hard for her and she was busy. and she told us we can't order until everyone arrives because it was annoying for the kitchen. we were not served, we had to ask for everything from silverware after our food was delivered to pre-bussing our table and asking them to clear it (which resulted in a server knocking over a drink on us). the waitress even had the audacity to tell us we didn't need a replacement drink because he didn't spill the whole drink?! unbelievable.|1.0|2021-09-20 00:57:00

"what a truly special place! everything about the glen rock mill inn is superb, from its period decor and preserved interior to its classic menu with innovative twists (the grilled chicken cordon bleu is absolutely delicious, and the triple chocolate mousse cake is divine). this doesn't even begin to take into account the service (leland is a wonderful host!) and the atmosphere (cosy and stylish, at the same time). it is truly welcoming, tooguests are invited to walk around the restaurant, which features museum-like exhibitions. what i was struck most by, though, was how personable the staff are. i brought my father here for a special father's daywedding anniversary meal (it would've also been my parents' 51st). my father is very hard of hearing and has difficulty reading menus at times. not only did leland and the chef treat him like gold, they walked him through the specials and spoke to him with respect; the chef talked with us at length and even came back later to check in and make sure our meal and service were to our liking. the first thing my dad said to him was, ""we'll be back!"" my dad doesn't praise things lightly, so i knew this was quite a compliment from him to all. thank you, glen rock mill inn, for making this day so wonderful!"|5.0|2021-06-20 23:01:00

in defense of the restaurant, there was a large party in the back room. further, we know that it is a very tight labor market these days and that is affecting everybody. nevertheless, the service was slow. our server, however, was a delightful young lady and we enjoyed being her customers. the food is not terrible. nor is it inspired. it is very decent and reasonably appropriate for this price point. as hotel restaurants go, this is not bad. but it is not going to be one that you will put on the monthly checklist either. it is worth the trip if you were looking for somewhere new to try.|3.0|2022-01-24 17:35:00

"rita's has been a family favorite for birthdays and other celebrations for a decade. the menu changed a couple of years ago, and simply not as good, but we still enjoyed going. the ambiance is still lovely, and we always enjoy pulling up to the lovely grounds.
the service, however, has really gone downhill. there is a service shortage, so i am always cognizant of being grateful to the staff that does show up for work. so, yes, the service was very slow, and we were not checked on after we received our food. that is not my complaint. the host seemed downright bored an uninterested in being there, after the card was run, the server came back and rushed me to tip out so she could go home. (her words). overall, it was an underwhelming experience not much different that going to ihop, unfortunately.
hopefully, staffing and training can be improved in the near future to make it an enjoyable place to go again."|3.0|2021-11-07 19:53:00

i was very disappointed with the hotel overall. i called the hotel to let them know i was planning to propose to my girlfriend on the saturday when we got down there. i asked them for the pamper package but not too have it laid out on check in as it would ruin the surprise. i was going out for the day told them of the plan i had to propose, and asked them too wait until i checked in and had gone out for the day so i could get it done and then that was to be an extra surprised when i returned i had kept this a secret for a long time and didn't want to let on anything out of the ordinary was going to happen that day. i had also requested an early check in the day before hand as 4pm was very late, we arrived at 12 and did not check in until after 3. on check in the pamper package was on the room and this had ruined the surprise. also i told the hotel twice the week leading up of this and was assured this wouldn't happen. this was a special weekend for my self and girlfriend and i thiught it was odd that not one member of staff congratulated her on the engagement. over all i was dissapointed with the staff and set up. stayed in june 2021|1.0|2021-06-22 01:00:00

tanner's customer service is one of the greatest i've experienced at a resort restaurant. their servers are extremely attentive and asked us if we needed anything at appropriate times. the food was also amazing, the mozz sticks and braised short ribs in particular, and the cake was decadent as well. overall, i would highly recommend tanner's if you're looking for an ambient, fancy place to eat around huntington beach, despite the slightly pricey menu, which was 100% worth it.|4.0|2021-07-27 08:26:00
clean, comfortable ive stayed here several times with good experiences. this time was different. we had a 530am flight so we asked what time to be in the lobby to catch shuttle. we were told to be there at 330am. we arrived at 325 and were told the shuttle would be arriving in 20 minutes, this making for a rushed time at the airport. we informed the night manager that we were told there would be a shuttle at 330. he had little empathy and told us to wait. when another guest arrived with the same problem he agreed to pay for a taxi. other than this experience and a very busy restaurant that did not being my partner's order, things were ok.|2.5|2021-12-06 01:00:00

pull apart bread, gyoza and the catch of the day, a snapper, we're excellent. grilled kampachi (amberjack) was meh, and the trumpet mushrooms didn't work. we had a lovely albarino ($75 per bottle). poke was fine but not the best we've had. the server took a long time to take our enter orders. the front deskhostesses were terrific and let us linger over drinks way after our table was ready. know this, you can only get reservations 48 hours in advance (on open table) and it fills up fast. lovely setting on a huge outdoor seaside deck at the upscale mauna lani hotel.|5.0|2021-12-01 00:25:00

the guy at the key collection place was extremely rude to the point where he said he had the power to cancel my appointment if he wanted to, he was so rude, he never sent me out an email stating that a deposit was needed or letting me know where to collect the key so i was taken by surprise, never again will i stay there or recommend it to anyone. to add on top of it he said he was closing the office at 5 so we wouldn't be able to check in until 9 afterwards which was never stated to us in advance. i've never felt so violated in my life. it was clean and convenient stayed in december 2020|0.5|2021-01-01 00:00:00

was fun to see the red and blue kitchen areas and dining area was very nice. prices are a bit high but we knew we were paying for being in a celebrity type restaurant. scallops were moist and tender. beef wellington was delicious and so tender could cut with my butter knife (such a shame i could only eat half of it and being as i was staying in a hotel i had no way to save the rest). the most amazing thing was the sticky toffee pudding. it is heavenly! service was great too. the one drawback was the lobster risotto. lobster was good but the risotto was under cooked and slightly crunchy. not edible. over all i gave 4 out of 5 but really expected all the food to be a 7-8 out of five. maybe my expectations of a gordon ramsey kitchen were just too high. i'm going to say i would recommend but only if it's on someone's bucket list.|4.0|2022-01-15 17:11:00

"awful service. come if you want to wait three hours for small plates. to get food you have to speak to every single employee and still wait hours. tables all around us were leaving and getting up. we stayed the course but the manager didnt feel the need to speak to us or even say sorry. there was no pita but on the table while we waited hours. apps were good but not worth the wait. entrees weren't even served hot after all that time. no point in going unless you want to just get a room in the hotel, go to sleep, and eat it for breakfast the next morning. that could be an option, but to try to hide the fact no food was being served the cranked up the music to full volume so you couldn't hear anything. yes, it's south beach and the music should be fun and loud but this was a tactic to try to ""distract"" customers that in no way could possibly work. i was so excited to come and post to my food account and review the restaurant but this was such a disappointing experience. the manger needs to be retrained and i guess they need more kitchen staff. unfortunately, i don't recommend coming."|2.0|2021-12-27 09:21:00

"such a shame as the restaurant had in a private event the same night which meant the staff were rushed and not as attentive as they should have been.
we waited about 12 hour from being seated for someone to come and take our order. my partner went direct to the bar to get a drink and was served instantly.
the starter came out about 20 minutes later however there was about a 40minute wait between starter and main.
when the main arrived the cauliflower cheese i ordered was cold in the centre and after a couple of bites of the chicken pie i found a bone so the rest of the meal i was unable to finish.
the staff offered me a complementary drink and originally discounted the meal but 50% i had to push for the meal to be on the house which was a shame considering the overall experience that we had.
i wouldn't go back to the restaurant. i would happily stay in the hotel but eat elsewhere."|2.0|2022-01-18 05:53:00

ledges is one of our favorite restaurants in the north conway area and we always enjoy our dinners there. this meal was no exception. we were seated promptly at a window table as requested. our server (bernie) was exceptional! the dinner menu is extremely varied, with over 15 entre choices. both our meals (salmon and prime rib) were exactly as ordered and both were excellent. the live piano music in the dining room just added to the experience.|5.0|2021-08-15 22:44:00

"delicious food, great space - all we'd expected from mark hix. but.we ordered a glass each of the house white (before ordering food) and were encouraged to order viognier instead because ""whilst it's more expensive, the house white is a bit sharp."" if your house wine isn't good enough to recommend, don't sell it - we were made to feel cheap a) for sticking with the house wine and b) asking for bread, being told that meant paying for the focaccia with whipped something or other. we just wanted some bread with our starter and were finally allowed to have some as a favour (for less s than the option on the menu). it was a shame as that coloured our experience but with such great food, i will go back."|4.0|2021-09-19 13:20:00

front desk staff i had a superb check-in, can't complain about the front desk staff at all. the room was .. right under the kitchen fan i assume, slept after 3am had to wake up at 5 because of the bus. not just that the outside fan was noisy people in the hotel as well. couldn't open the window because if i did so the room smelled like the kitchen. shower drain isn't draining properly and when i opened it to help it i got scared how dirty black it was .. i myself work in housekeeping so i know how busy it gets but also this size of a room could be done daily superbly and spotless clean and especially bathroom deep clean this size? 5 minutes not more .. also in the bathroom was left over toiletries from the previous guest which now in pandemic isn't alright and the floors weren't hoovered or moped at all and carpet too. but it's a good value for money and location and front desk in superb 5*|1.5|2021-08-03 02:00:00

our whole family loved o'donoghue's! from the moment we arrived, oliver the proprietor was so kind and accommodating - we would come back just to see him! they were able to accommodate our party of 6 - 2 grandparents, 2 parents, and 2 teens -- in three rooms close to each other. grandparents got the room at the top of the stairs and the rest of us one short staircase up. the rooms were larger than i expected with very modern renovated bathrooms with fabulous shower pressure. each room had big sunny windows, with double panes that could be shut at night to help keep out the noise from the bar and the street (although i'd still bring ear plugs to be safe). a nice big wardrobe for clothes and suitcases and an electric kettle & tea accessories. beds were very comfortable, too! really, the rooms were way more comfortable than i was expecting. best of all, especially for guiness-loving grandpa, was staying above the pub. always fun things going on down there, from live music all day on the weekends to great people watching pretty much any time of the day or night. we have already recommended it to friends who are headed there next week. the other benefit for us was the location - an easy walk to book of kellstrinity, just around the corner from oscar wilde's birthplace and the department of the taoiseach, and on the other side, the lovely st. stephen's green. will absolutely stay here the next time we're in dublin. can't think of anything|5.0|2021-11-18 01:00:00

"all seemed a bit disorganised possibly due to a large and rowdy family group who were just finishing up when we arrived. staff were pleasant and friendly but didn't seem aware of the set menu offer through opentable and this caused some minor issues for the restaurant when we were paying the bill.
the sunday roast was generally good but there were a couple of things that could be improved. the beef was exceptionally pink to the point of being raw which was okay for me but would not suit everyone and the only other option we were given was 'well done'. my mother took that option but was disappointed to find that the beef had been sliced and pan fried which left an unpleasant after taste and texture. the large yorkshire puddings looked impressive but were over cooked. these were small things overall that could easily be improved.
the wine list was decent but i had to ask for a drinks menu.
despite the issues noted above, we did enjoy the our meals and the portion size was good. would go again but probably on the a la carte menu."|4.0|2021-11-17 09:54:00

reception staff were under so much pressure at check in but in fairness they done their very best and personally i found the lady i dealt with was very helpful. hotel seemed nice and clean. beds were comfortable. before we got to check into the hotel. we spent roughly 1015 minutes with roughly 15 other people in the car park trying to get into the hotel. unfortunately nobody was buzzing us in. quiet a long wait at reception due to everyone checking in at the same time. we had been told the day before when we called the hotel that the swimming pool was completely booked out for our stay. in the restaurant at 4pm there were 2 tables occupied while we were there.. from the time we ordered it took 45 minutes for our food to arrive at the table (chips and burgers). breakfast, about 20minutes of a wait.|1.0|2021-08-04 02:00:00

"i have been to this new milo's restaurant twice now. first time for lunch and second for dinner. i had a calamari starter followed by wild salmon with potatoes, broccoli and asparagus. all were very palatable, veggies were delightfully not overcooked. my choices were pretty safe so i cannot comment further. i ordered their baklava purely to check how authentic they were. it was delicious with just enough honey ( maybe a tad more for me ) and the filo pastry was light but again, could have been drenched more but i think this is a personal preference rather than the guideline. my partner ordered a ""chocolate sin"" which had no description whether it was a mousse, soufle or something else. it was something else. not too sure how i would describe this triangle cut thinnish looking slab of chocolate. tasting this i still wasn't sure what it was, cake it wasn't, cheesecake no, soufle it definitely was not. it was a thick flour less hardish slice of chocolate that had obviously been tempered with maybe eggs and cream or yogurt then poured to set. it stuck to the roof of my mouth, full on with chocolate but not in a good way for me. i'm sure chocky lovers will delight in this dessert but sadly not for me. the side of raspberries were needed to enhance the dish. overall this is a beautiful restaurant with delightful staff who are attentive especially marcus. the display of fresh fish, shellfish and veggies was very pretty. it is expensive but you are in a 5 star hotel complex. it is not 5 star fine dining but great for a good fish lunch or dinner ( by the way their 3 course lunch menu is just $38 which is marvellous ). our meal without wine was $ 330 without 20% tip."|4.0|2021-05-04 21:53:00

our server was very friendly and accommodating. we did not have to wait for anything. the service was wonderful. the food came quick. we dined w an 80 year old family member and everyone was very kind and patient with her.
the biscuits and gravy were delicious. huge portions. i was extremely excited for the tots but was very disappointed w the flavor. it struck me as odd. the aioli was so flavorful though. the pancakes were very good but it would be helpful to have sugar free syrup due to diabetic patrons. mimosas were great, heavy on champagne. coffee was good. tasted a lot like french press.
all in all a good visit. it could have been better but we were happy w our overall visit."|4.0|2022-02-11 23:10:00

very accommodating and helpful staff. location very close to everything central. if you can get a space in the car park, it's the cheapest you'll get. the room was clean and we had a lovely view of the river. it's a prime location really. minor gripe is that the area had a lot of vagrants and felt a little unsafe at night at times. the hotel's own car park is small and a bit of a gamble to get space. my advice is not to park in the nearby lapps quay carpark - total rip off at 25 euro a day. there are others across the bridge for a fraction of the price.|4.5|2022-05-24 02:00:00

very pleasant afternoon tea served outside in the garden. weather wasn't great but by the time the heater kicked in we forgot about that. given the option to swap out a sandwich filling we didn't like for another. beautiful scones and very pretty little cakes. our waiter was great and we were swimming in tea by the end. we needed a doggy bag as we couldn't finish all the cakes at the time|4.0|2021-09-08 15:33:00

the room was spacious and clean. but i asked for our 2 rooms to be near each other and they weren't, they were on levels 3 & 5. we had to call down to desk to ask for more pillows and towels to accommodate the 3 people staying in each room. one room never received the request. the desk was very busy, but was able to print our boarding passes which we were very grateful to have in hand. overall i would stay here again as it was very close to the airport and the shuttle service was quick and timely. the room was spacious and clean. but i asked for our 2 rooms to be near each other and they weren't, they were on levels 3 & 5. we had to call down to desk to ask for more pillows and towels to accommodate the 3 people staying in each room. one room never received the request. the desk was very busy, but was able to print our boarding passes which we were very grateful to have in hand. overall i would stay here again as it was very close to the airport and the shuttle service was quick and timely.|3.5|2021-09-20 02:00:00
cheap toilet roll in the bathroom. party coming from other room so bit noisy but not hotels fault. would of liked info on things to do in the area in a welcome package, definitely would of taken advantage of that the staff were all very pleasant and friendly. the location is right in the centre of town so easy to walk around. food was good, just wish there was more options on the menu to choose from. stayed in june 2021|3.5|2021-06-08 01:00:00

i stayed in this hotel about 10 years ago and swore i would not return. it was the four seasons then but is now the intercontinental. it took a while, but i did return, and it was a fantastic stay we would definitely stay again. the staff were warm and friendly, and the food was lovely. the room was comfortable and cosy, right next door to the rds. nothing|4.5|2022-10-17 02:00:00
"my bad for not thoroughly reading the reviews, but the profile on open table was a bit misleading. this is not a restaurant with brunch, but rather the breakfast area of a hotel. there is no way our reservation could have been accommodated had they been busy at the time.
most of our group got the american breakfast plate which was fine, the benedict, however, was served cold with eggs overcooked to the extent that they were soft boiled.
additionally, they sold us an espresso, never brought it out, then when we asked said the machine was down to be cleaned. cleaning the machine is great, but it would make more sense to either tell your customer that when they try to order or to finish your orders first. the machine was not operational until we had finished our meal."|3.0|2021-10-03 14:16:00
we got upgraded in rooms once we arrived and all the staff were very helpful. the hotel did a great job adapting to guild lines and the estate walks were brilliant|4.5|2021-07-22 02:00:00
breakfast service was excellent. location was also very good for our needs eg trip to glendalough. tayto park, zoo etc.. free car parking was good too as we had a car. various measures in place for covid eg multiple sanitizers, rooms only cleaned if requested, doors open to corridors with fans blowing during the day to create excellent ventilation in public areas. dinner service was extremely slow, we had to ask for our table to be cleared and for our deserts to be delivered. we waited at least 20mins before we asked for table to be cleared. we were right beside the entrance so staff were passing us regularly but nobody seem to notice that we had finished our dinners and were waiting for table to be cleared and desserts to be served. as a result we cancelled our dinner booking for another evening and ate elsewhere.|4.0|2021-07-24 02:00:00

located on the ground floor of an old historic building in downtown los angeles - now hosting the proper hotel - the lobby caferestaurant serves an eclectic, latin-focused but not limited to menu. it is not cheap but it is very well prepared and served. the waitstaff is top-notch. only drawback were the toilets located on the 2nd floor. the entrance is secured by a doorman who checks vaccination cards, id's and mask-wearing is required within the building as per the requirements of the los angeles county health department.|4.0|2022-01-03 02:31:00
every member of staff we came into contact with was extremely pleasant and helpful. they're doing a great job. the security of the hotel, entering, using your room key for the elevator etc was reassuring. breakfast was really good - a nice variety and good quality. the place seems a little bit tired. the hallways leading to the rooms felt a bit dull and tired. our room has a strong smell of smoke on entering, which was reported and the guy on reception couldn't have apologised more and gave us a complimentary breakfast. we don't like to complain but had to make the staff aware - we stayed in the room as we don't like to cause a fuss but the smell remained for the whole weekend, so might be something to do with the air con system or vents around that room area.|3.5|2022-02-28 01:00:00

the view was great. the service not so much. the two servers that i saw seemed to be manning the whole ship. poor restaurants are so under staffed these days i hate to write anything bad. so my only complaint was that i felt a little robbed for paying over $100 bucks for two orders of avocado toast and two drinks each. make sure to over tip your waiters please. they are just trying to do their best!!|3.0|2021-11-16 06:33:00

marie from the front desk dark haired lady with red glasses was absolutely amazing with her help. she's a complete asset to the hotel she was very accommodating and welcoming ! the bed was a small bit uncomfortable and the pillows were way too soft. that's just my own comfort preference but this did not affect my experience within the hotel as the facilities and staff were more than amazing !|4.0|2021-10-13 02:00:00
"absolutely will be back. we loved the decor, the setting (especially being able to watch the planes from the bedroom window), the breakfast was wide ranging and plentiful (except for cooked vegetarian options). a really comfy night's sleep with a good size bathroom with separate shower and bath. air conditioning in the bedroom would also encourage us to use the hotel in the summer. would have been ideal if there was an electric car charging point available but we know that there are very few places that would have one. unfortunately we were disappointed in the size of the pizzas we ordered. they were advertised as 12"" but they were probably less than 8"". we did call back room service and they sent another up but was still only 8""."|4.5|2021-11-07 01:00:00
