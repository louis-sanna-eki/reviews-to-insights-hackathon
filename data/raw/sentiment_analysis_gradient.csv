33,"the experience was okay. the pre-dinner drinks at the bar were superb and the staff friendly and helpful. we really, really wanted to love the food
the appetizers we had were very nice - pimento cheese arancini with a green tomato chutney. i had the quail. it was served with greens and potatoes.
while the flavor and preparation of the quail was wonderful, my potatoes and greens were not hot. and not just luke warm, but room temp. it just really took away from the point of having a warm comfort food experience to be served mains that just were not warm. and while the flavor was fine, i can only imagine how much better this review and my experience would've been if my food had been hot when served.
the gravy was really flavorful, there just wasn't enough of it and it was placed on the fried quail which made the breading lose much of it's fried crunch goodness.
if i had received warm potatoes with a hot helping of the amazing gravy on them, this would be a much different review.
we had a flourless chocolate cake dessert, that was also served super cold as if it had just come from the walk in freezer (we couldn't get our spoons through it) and while it was tasty, it was only okay. we ordered coffee and it was also served at room temperature. not ideal on a cold winter night. the server apologized and took off the coffee from our bill, but that was just the final ehh in a meal i really wanted to love but walked away from feeling, well, e .

59,"this hotel is such a mixed bag of opinions to be honest. gym is amazing pool is great hotel is clean. parking is good. it's a short 10 mins from the town but it lacks in variety of food choices especially if you have special dietary needs. they cater poorly for coeliac vegetarian or vegan guests. no effort was made to accommodate. service was very very slow. some of the staff are really good and others just don't have any initiative what so ever. tables were left uncleared for over a hour despite the amount of staff floating around. ordered drinks don't arrive. i understand teething issues for not being open for so long but at the same time guests are looking forward to a hotel experience and paying quite high prices for it, but the service and attention to detail just wasn't there. another issue being the over service of alcohol to already very drunk guests, room parties throughout the night and the walls are paper thin. it just wasn't what we had hoped for unfortunately. management was very customer focused when we voiced our complaints and also made every effort to make amense. the menu really needs to be looked at. restaurant and bar staff really need a crash course in customer service. ordered a jug of water for the table for breakfast and was handed a small glass that was half full. wasn't even a mouthfull of water.. i couldn't believe it. stayed in june 2021",2.0,2021-06-06 01:00:00,"[[0.7275041341781616, 0.26939836144447327, 0.00309746153652668]]"

101,"a total disaster. never seen so many confused people trying to run a restaurant.
it took us, a party of 4 to acknowledge the disaster of an evening unfolding before our eyes.
we first tried laughing off the awkwardness. simple requests such as turning gas light took 25 minutes to no avail.
asking for drinks to reset the night were not heeded.
we closed our eyes trying to understand if the twilight zone moment was for real and, well, yes it was.
last attempt was to call the management who listened to our 30 minutes of unresponsiveness.
staring at the floor, he said yes no problem, we will take care of it.
2 minutes later, after our waiter pacing back and forth 13 times, flipping his order taking notepad, we got up only to find manager making drinks for another table.

a big birthday to celebrate, so we started with cocktails: smoked negroni was delicious, and the espresso martini - well, a 'patronnie' actually, with some tequilacoffee drink that's new to me - and is now firmly on my christmas list
the cauliflower popcorn here is narcotic, and not to be missed.
duck salad with watermelon was perfect, and my seared yellowfin tuna sashimi, the best i've had.
chicken milanese might be a simple dish, but it can be mediocre; this one was sublime. the duck leg i chose for my main was fabulous. we couldn't even finish the truffle and parmesan fries, let alone consider dessert.

2) our waiter was fully aloof the entire time and seemed annoyed to have to serve us. wearing circular sunglasses and a man-bun, and listening to our confusion over the menu (i can't order eggs benedict??), he seemed annoyed at our questions over what was available. we also had to ask a busser to call our waiter back to handle a second round of drink orders because we were promptly neglected for 20+ minutes after our initial food order arrived. it felt like asking a favor to get service here. this particular waiter was far too cool for us, the brunch menu was hyper limited, so not returning to this venue.",2.0,2021-12-17 08:04:00,"[[0.5923323631286621, 0.4051876962184906, 0.0024799180682748556]]"

we were celebrating our anniversary (as marked on our booking) but were seated at a table next to the till and the stairs to the toilets that felt very much in the gangway.
the tea service looked attractive but the quality of the items was just average.
the clotted cream seemed to be long life clotted cream that you can keep out of the fridge and had a very powdery texture. (surely rodda's can be afforded at 55 per head?) the crab puri, which should be crisp, was soggy and the scones were dry. the best item was the samosa. nothing else really stands out as exceptional.
we weren't offered any suggestions by the suited waiter when it came to teas and the same staff member seemingly had no idea what was in the vanilla orchid oolong flavoured tea i enquired about simply stating that he didn't drink tea himself but oolong is a lighter tea. i knew that much already.
i was expecting exceptional food and service but the petersham delivered neither. though the member of the waiting team that served us our complementary anniversary sorbet was by far the best staff member to serve us and almost single handedly rescued an otherwise poor service. i really can't find any reason to recommend this place. you could get a much better cream tea at a national trust cafe.",1.0,2021-08-09 18:13:00,"[[0.8335652351379395, 0.16420894861221313, 0.002225744305178523]]"

517,"not sure why my avatar says jacksonville we came from our home in doylestown.
the location is beautiful and the older building was inviting. once inside, we waited a few minutes to be greeted despite a few staff members noticing we were there. once greeted by the hostess, my husband and i were led to a table not more then two feet from the only table in the room while the other tables sat empty. after some hesitation which made us feel as though we were putting them out, we were shown to another table. throughout our meal, only one other table arrived. the menu was great and had a lot of unique dishes including many for vegetarians which is appreciated.
our first course was french onion soup which we agreed was very good. unfortunately, we were not even a quarter of the way through our soup when our meals were brought out and very awkwardly forced onto the table along with our soups rather then being taken back to the kitchen to be re-fired later when we were ready. on to dinner, my husband had a salmon which unfortunately was very dry with no sauce but a dry paste under it. i had opted for a cheese plate which had an excellent stilton and house made boursin, the other two cheeses however were tasteless and not enjoyed. this on top of the party of four shouting their way through the meal was enough. we normally order coffee and desert but were too disappointed to bother. i rarely leave a negative review but unfortunately, there wasn't much positive to say which is unfortunate and unusual for us. i was hoping for a hidden gem but found a restaurant i would not return to. also, new carpeting is sorely needed.",2.0,2021-10-26 18:51:00,"[[0.002219485118985176, 0.9792435765266418, 0.018536977469921112]]"

as said the food was nice but would have been a higher score if hotter. no one asked us how our meal was and we felt rushed. i had finished my dinner and my husband was still eating and my plate was taken and i was asked if i wanted a dessert.
i appreciate it was fathers day but it was later in the afternoon, and when we arrived we were told it was a restricted menu, which i understand. however the only roast was beef and yet there was chicken on the childrens menu. i did ask but was told no . it would have been nice to have seen this restricted menu on the website before we got there.

for a second portion of bread.
we were celebrating our 18th anniversary, wanted everything to be perfect, and all of a sudden there's a hostess at our table lecturing us on restaurant policy. it was frankly embarrassing. we ended up paying over $150 for dinner including tax & tips, and they're pimping on us over $2 worth of bread. my wife and i felt like we were being targeted, for reasons unknown. the hostess was not rude or hostile when explaining the issue with the bread, but she was very condescending.

our server was amazing. he was attentive and helpful. my rating of 35 stars comes mainly from the appetizers.
we were starving when we arrived, so we ordered 3. the scallops were delicious, but there were only 2 of them and the chorizo they came with was just ok. we definitely didn't feel that we got value for our money with that dish. the potato rolls were delicious when you ate them together with the mushrooms and the haskap sauce. however, the filling was chalky and the first bite was a little off-putting. once i got past the texture, i enjoyed them. finally, we ordered the carpaccio. when we finished this dish, i tod my husband i felt confused. it didn't really taste like anything, and i wasn't sure how you were supposed to eat it. we ended up scooping it onto the provided chips. i would not order it again. at the end of 3 appetizers we were still starving and were planning where we would stop for food on the way to the hotel if the mains were similar.
our mains were delicious and a great size. i had the mussels, and my husband had the trout. both were superb.
every dish we ordered was buried under a handful of baby or micro-greens. i didn't feel they added anything to the flavour of the dishes, and since each dish was covered, it didn't help the presentation.

938,"while the vegetable and meat selections are acceptable (thanks for adding on tofu and sausages to the selection). what makes this experience disappointing is the broth and appetizers. all the broths have very little flavor and the dipping sauces don't make up for it. the appetizers were cold, stale, and not very tasty. sushi selection is minimal nothing to be impressed over. desserts did not have any visual appeal (maybe just the cotton candy) and they had a breadbakery selection that looked worse than your standard motel continental breakfast.
when i compare this restaurant to alternative all-you-can eat chinese hot pot restaurants, i just don't see how they can compete in the meatbrothsauce category since chinese hot pot beats this restaurant by miles in flavor and in price.
the only area where this restaurant can shine is in the appetizersdesserts, which i have mentioned is severely lackluster. i guess you get the robot that delivers your meat? that's pretty cool. you get your own individual hotpot? i guess if you don't like sharing, but you can't bring more than 3 guests because aren't set up for it.
i just don't see this restaurant saying in business for long with a $37 price point when there are like so many tastier all you can eat options within a 15 min drive.",2.0,2021-09-24 18:19:00,"[[0.9021408557891846, 0.09580361098051071, 0.002055611927062273]]"

we walked in a little before our 5:30 reservation time and we were promptly greeted and seated. a waiter came and brought water and bread. our server then came and dropped off the veggies before the meal. brined cucumbers and red bell peppers. different but so good!
our server jordan then came and took my drink order. i needed to substitute the grapefruit bitters but it was no problem and the drink was awesome. i ordered the 14oz rib eye with smashed potatoes and my husband ordered the tomahawk chops with smashed potatoes.
my rib eye was the best one i've ever had. i enjoy steakhouses and we go to an expensive one at least 2x's a year. this was hands down the best one. it was tender but crunchy and melted in my mouth. my husband loved his chops (it said t reminded him of the flintstones) and the random carrot. the applesauce was also really good.
jordan was attentive, the ambience was nice and it was a great date night dinner. the tool used to clean up the breadcrumbs was cool and having our eating utensils switched out before the meal was an extra step that was appreciated.",5.0,2021-11-14 02:34:00,"[[0.017098335549235344, 0.5748999714851379, 0.4080016613006592]]"

walking in is a convoluted experience, and the first thing i saw was a large screen tv playing commercials almost immediately took me out of the experience. the paintings are obvious prints, that don't look that great up close. which wouldn't be an issue except that we sat directly in front of one.
there's a lot that could be done to improve upon the noise level and decor, some sound absorptions panels installed on the ceilings or walls would be a welcome improvement, and carpet would have also been a nice touch, ultimately, i felt that i was in a (nice) hotel lobby, not a high-end resturaunt.

1525,"this was a difficult review to write because there was so many mixed feelings on the overall experience.
plenty of free parking, once you park you walk to the hotel, take the elevator up to roof and you're right there, quick and easy access.
we had reservations and were seated right away. the first thing we noticed was the amazing ambience, 1010. classy guests, in fact i felt a little underdressed.
our waitress was great. she was on top of everything and very sharp, that was 1010 as well.
now for the disappointments.
the menu was a spanish fusion type. to be quite honest it was hard to make out what was on the menu. it's almost as if they're trying too hard to be sophisticated thinking it would add more class.
when we got our apps it was mediocre and i'm being nice. we had some pork type of dish which had a lot of fat on there. then we had dinner. all 3 of us had the steak. while it was very tasty it was also a bit cold. not to the point where we would send it back but c'mon, steak has to be served hot, that's 101. it was clear that the steaks had cooled off. easy fix for this is to have the steak served on heated plates. overall the food was a 3 or 4 out of 10.
now for the drinks, and this was probably even more of a let down than the food. we ordered the followingannoyedn-house moscow mule
-mojito
-dry martini
their drinks are off, they don't taste what their supposed to, very bland. i don't know if the bartender was off that day or what. but a place like this cannot have below average drinks. i score the drinks a 2 or 3 out of 10.
our bill was over $300 and we were just 3 people and we didn't order a lot of food and drinks. the overall value is a 110 for our money.
the place has so much potential. my advice is to get a new bartender asap.
2nd, go basic on the menu. basic but tasty. bring some sliders and fries. they didn't even have fries on the menu. i called and gave my opinions and was told the manager would call me but he never did. that was also disappointing.",1.0,2021-04-11 18:31:00,"[[0.07509369403123856, 0.8963862061500549, 0.028520120307803154]]"

1708,"a tad disappointed. we had high expectations for carversteak and perhaps a few more weeks to get all the kinks out may have been a better option.
we used the valet service for our car to which the attendant informed us that the valet charge would be $25 a tad steep for an off boulevard hotel.
we then had to walk 800 yards to carversteak good thing i wore my walking boots. the valet attendant could have sent us to a closer valet station, they have 4 stations. i guess he wanted the $20 tip that i dished out prior to knowing the distance we would need to walk.
once in the restaurant all was good until they sat a group of four quite loud gentlemen at the table next to us. the music was nice but we couldn't hear it, partially because of the restaurant's acoustics and the loud table next to us.
the service was excellent until they tried to deliver a drink order that the table next to us had ordered. the menu did not list their selection of 375ml wine bottles so we had to wait for the wine specialist to provide their options.
dinner finally, the baby lettuce wedges were very good but $19 was a tad steep for lettuce, a few cherry tomatoes, bacon bits and a little dressing. ya get what ya pay for, the profit margin on this item is impressive! oh yea that brings me back to my old fashioned adult beverage - again a very handsome profit margin! our filets were outstanding, tender as possible! the brussel sprouts were outstanding but the potato croutons were fresh out of the freezer - not worth the coin.
there was no mango sorbet so we had to settle for passion fruit sorbet. concurrently, they had to make a run to a different bar to grab a bottle of drambuie for an ordered ""drambuie on the rocks"" but delivered neat. they were kind enough to put a few ice cubes in the drink.
finally the bill came to $336 so i made it an even $410 tip included. we will return but with so many choices in vegas i'm not sure when??",4.0,2022-01-07 09:30:00,"[[0.7497889995574951, 0.24663034081459045, 0.0035806214436888695]]"

2011,"my party of 4 went to gerrard street kitchen for easter brunch. the only thing they were serving was a $75 price fixed menu. i should've known something was wrong because the place was almost empty when i arrived. the only other diners in the restaurant's indoor dining room were at a single long table near the bar. there were about 4 adults, one of whom was speaking so loud he was practically yelling. even louder were the roughly 4 children at his table. the kids were actually screaming and the adults were doing nothing about it. the server, who told us others had left because of the loud diners, asked them to quiet down and they didfor one minute. then the screaming started again.
the brief experience we had with the food was also unfortunate. we were brought the first course which was a 2 ""baskets"" of muffins and croissants4 total in each basket. the muffins and croissants were very small, the croissants were rubbery, and there was no butter. that seemed a bit cheap and low quality for $75 per person. we then ordered ice tea, but they brought us apple juice insteadapparently someone but juice in the ice tea carafe. the server went back to get the ice tea, but then advised they didn't have any and it would take over 20 minutes to make it! that mishap, on top of the $25 parking fee to park at the hotel even if you were dining at the restaurant, was the last straw. we left immediately, ruining our easter brunch plans. i will say that our server was very polite and apologetic, and the restaurant didn't charge us for the joke of a muffin basket.",1.0,2022-04-18 02:19:00,"[[0.5523333549499512, 0.4458034336566925, 0.0018632282735779881]]"

no bread.
wine was never poured for me beyond the first class.
zero privacy between tables. hardly romantic if you're on a date and have to crawl over people. i had to ask the people at the neighboring table to get up when i needed to use the toilet. that's how close the tables are.

the food is cooked really fresh cooked pretty much to perfection (i had the turbot) although the frites side dish was far too salty.
the main dishes are quite large portions so could be easily shared which was actually encouraged by my waiter kevin who was a very attentive and friendly guy. i actually came out of the restaurant feeling really full so could have cut back on the amount ordered. in fact we did ask to take away some of the desert ordered but was told it was not permitted. quite frankly i found that ridiculous as it just went to waste and it's food we had paid for.
a great place to celebrate an occasion like anniversary or birthday as it has a fantastic location on the corner of leicester square and has a nice ambience. the restaurant was quite full at the time so was a little on the noisy side but not too overbearing. we could still talk quite comfortably.

the food was truly delish, unless it wasn't. of the 3 of us, one had the grilled cheese and soup - perfection. one had the market plate with chicken, fries and roasted broccoli. the chicken & fries: excellent. the broccoli: charred on the outside, hard in the middle. i had the market plate with salmon, mac&chs & bacon&blue brussels. the salmon: superb. the mac&chs: good. i'd have it again. the brussels: no blue in sight, hard in the middle and covered in too much vinegar.
the atmosphere: the website does a good job of making it look larger and more comfy than it really is. expect a multi-purpose diner. not uncomfortable, but not someplace you want to really spend time, either. and surprisingly loud. very echo-y.
the service: the hostess was awesome. cheerful, on it. the server was less so. not rude, just not *there* either. rarely saw her throughout the meal. but what really got to us was something that happened at another table. the two guests accidentally knocked over one of their beers. it spilled all over their table and the floor by them. not one server came to help. multiple servers - including ours - walked by, looked at it and kept going. no one offered to wipe down their now sticky table, or the floor. they had to go fetch linen napkins from another table to handle it themselves. even more: their server and a runner form the kitchen brought out their meals, were told about the incident, served their food over the mess on the floor and never came back to clean it up. having served and cooked in a number of restaurants over the years, i was offended for the couple at this display of just not giving a d*mn.

2412,"food service drink was all wonderful, the ambience there is very relaxing and upscale.
i've been coming to this restaurant for years and now, maybe slow down in business, due to the pandemic, they charge a 4% fee for using a credit card. if their costs have gone up they should not pass that along to the consumer.
that is very tacky for an upscale restaurant.
i made the reservation on open table and i did not see that included as information maybe it was.
the restaurant was not very busy as it was only a monday night. they should be giving me a 4% break in our bill for patronizing. charges on atms aren't even that high.
if anything it should be a flat fee not a percent of your bill as ours was quite high. i am assuming if the bank does charge them a fee for processing credit cards it is per purchase not based on the dollar amount of the bill.
maybe time to find a new place for calamari appetizer, prime rib, brie stuffed chicken breast and delicious creme brulee. we
and delicious desserts.

2585,"situated in the lobby of the chic and stylish hyatt place hotel, ema's natural vibes of wood and greenery foster and airy atmosphere welcoming enough to relax even the most formal diners. everyone at ema was there to have fun, and the hip pumping bass playlist interspersed itself with energetic conversation.
now for the food. mediterranean cuisine focuses on fresh, simple flavors like lemon, garlic, and sesame. ema took the art form to its highest level. i can honestly say i have never tasted better mediterranean food in my life, nor have i had a better meal downtown.
the eggplant spread comes served with warm and irresistible pita bread, toasted to perfection and sprinkled with persian spices. the cauliflower is artistically plated with greek yogurt and a subtle touch of honey to complement the fresh crunch of vegetable.
emma's house specialty--the brussel sprouts--are sweetly glazed, charred, and tossed with pumpkin seeds. most everyone has eaten brussel sprouts before, but you have never tasted them like this.
i quite recommend the mushroom kabob for the rich grilled portobellos and pungent, pesto-like sauce served on the side. i would love to ask chef cj jacobson where the syrupy, date-and-fig-like flavor on this dish came from.
for carnivores, the beef kabob is seasoned generously with what tasted like turmeric, parsley, and onion--just like a traditional middle eastern kofta grill of meat. but save room for dessert! the honey pie (see picture attached) is handsomely presented with a dollop of home-made whipped cream, sweet candied red grapes (which were addictive; i could have eaten a whole bowl of those alone), and a garnish of sesame seeds. the dish was every bit as sweet and satisfying as it sounds.
the staff here are very friendly, and service is quick. as for me, i have found my new favorite place to eat in chicago and--god-willing--look forward to making many more special memories in this impeccable mediterranean restaurant.",5.0,2022-03-06 19:38:00,"[[0.011206553317606449, 0.6962721943855286, 0.29252129793167114]]"

the ploughmans had by two of us was disappointing. it was trying to be fancy, which is ok, but the amount served for 13.50 was measly. just one piece of bread and one small piece of cheese (it was local cheese but to be honest i'm not sure most people would really care so long as it was nice), plus half a gherkin, a few halves silver-skin onions, a small pot of ham hock pate, a small portion of celeriac remoulade, a tablespoon of pickle, and some watercress. i'm glad i'm not a ploughman as i would not have been able to do another furrow on those rations.
my other friend's 14 ham and chicken pie was fine, if rather lacking in chicken, but the asparagus served alongside was limp. there were no other accompaniments.
neither dish was what you would call good value or memorable.
the serving staff, one in particular, need training in how to talk to customers. rather abrupt, no hint of a welcome, absolutely no warmth or friendliness. the cutlery and litter under the table when i sat down (outside) was inexcusable as it should have been removed by staff when they cleared the table. the trouble with little sachets of condiments is that they end up on the ground.

when we walked in, it took forever to take our drinks order.
we ordered our food and my sister ordered seafood moules, they came as white wine moules, she questioned this with the waitress who stated the seafood is there (she checked, it wasn't), she then raised this with someone else who said he would check with the chef, he never came back, she raised this a third time with the waitress who took our order and she accused my sister of ordering the wrong dish and she didn't order seafood which was not acceptable service; so we had to call on someone else, again and finally it got changed. to have to ask 4 times that it's the wrong dish and for it to be changed is not an acceptable service.
we then felt we had to call upon waitresseswaiters constantly as we felt they were avoiding our table.
finally we got our plates cleared and not once did we get offered a dessert menu, we had to ask. we finally ordered and when the puddings came out we had no cutlery so yet again, we had to ask. the waiter then came back with teaspoons, not dessert spoons so we had to wait again to ask someone to change this.
we had 2 small children under the age of 4 and a nice birthday lunch turned into 3 hours of having to constantly ask throughout the meal for different things which is not acceptable.

it was only when we went to pay and noted there was no reduction that we queried why no one had apologised or explained the issues. the manager then came over to say the chef was new and that there were communication problems as english was not his first language and that there had been other complaints about the food. i was embarrassed that we had to ask for a reduction on the bill and feel this should have been offered.",4.0,2021-09-26 16:26:00,"[[0.8494954705238342, 0.1485740840435028, 0.0019304817542433739]]"

3065,"evening dinning on the patio is very dark and it's hard to your food. there are no lights on the tables and just overhead decorative lights. additionally, the serving plates are dark gray which further complicates visually seeing your food.
we had a small flashlight that we used to walk from our room to the restaurant and we used it to read the menu and see our plates. the couple behind us used their cell phones.
when we commented on it to our food server he apologized said that he would talk to management. when we brought our bill, he had to use his cell phone to light it for us to see it. our server had adjusted our bill giving us his employee discount ($12) which was a nice, but it was not his issue. we tipped his discount plus as appreciation for his effort.
based our experience i would not recommend evening patio dinning if you want to see what you're eating. as for the food quality, my husband did enjoy the flat steak dinner (held the flash light so he could see it to cut the meat). my tortilla soup was lukewarm, the breakfast was average and at happy hour i had a shrimp quesadilla that was very bland and disappointing. i will say the burger i had was good and their cocktails were good.",2.0,2021-10-30 00:22:00,"[[0.3153493106365204, 0.6823572516441345, 0.00229342607781291]]"

my girlfriend (who is veggie) and i came for sunday roast. i had the pork which was absolutely delicious, and one of the best pub roasts i've had. the veggie roast (wellington) had unfortunately run out by the time we arrived, but the staff arranged to serve another main (aubergine) with roast trimmings, which was appreciated and enjoyed.
however, my partner noted that there were only two other veggie mains on the menu (the aubergine and a vegetable curry), both of which only contained vegetables and were not based around any sort of protein source. a cursory glance at the regular dining menu reveals a similar picture.

(the crazy thing it that is was right next door to our hotel. why, oh why, didn't i go there in the first place? live and learn..) anyway, i enjoyed the vibe and i loved the room. it all felt good. believe me when i say it got even better when the food arrived. high-level cooking in every dish. for instance, i've eaten a lot of calamari in my day (a lot!) and i was astounded to taste the best calamari of my life at il corso. it didn't matter what dish we ordered, the quality remained top notch. and, listen, the service was not about to be outdone by the cooking. marvellous attention to detail and to our wishes. we shared everything and il corso split every plate for us, they even split the glasses of wine we ordered! after leaving on a cloud, i cancelled a reservation at another restaurant and returned to il corso two nights later to an experience just as marvellous. i'm going to dine here every time i'm in ps. you should, too.",5.0,2022-04-20 01:44:00,"[[0.19197794795036316, 0.8060669898986816, 0.001955100568011403]]"

3383,"i rarely leave poor reviews but our experience was so bad i feel the need to warn others about this place. the restaurant is located behind the eden roc hotel overlooking the ocean which is why i chose it because of its ocean side location but the restaurant is surrounded by a plastic tent covering which cuts off the ocean breeze and kind of defeats the open aired outdoor dining experience. when we arrived the hostess was extremely unorganized and rude. we waited for several minutes while she seemed preoccupied, then walked back and forth a few times saying she was checking on our table before she finally came back to get us. she lead us to a table in the middle of the dining room clustered around a lot of other tables. when we expressed we weren't comfortable sitting in close proximity to other diners in a tent environment w no open air she seemed annoyed but allowed us to choose a table further removed along the ocean side. a few minutes after we sat down the manager came over w a disgustingly dirty mask barely covering his chin w his nose and mouth completely exposed and muttered some long winded talk about why our tables service would be slow and why we should have sat in the other clustered section the hostess wanted to seat us in. then our waiter appears at the table wearing no mask at all to take our order. we kindly ask if he can put on a mask and he proceeds to talk at us acting annoyed that we asked about the mask. he returns a few minutes later wearing a mask to take our order. we order 2 pizzas off the very limited menu. only one arrives on time. our second pizza arrives 20 min later.. neither pizza had much flavor and definitely not worth the $30 they are charging. the booths have food stains all over them and the whole place just seemed dirty and poorly managed. there are no covid guidelines in place and the staff is rude when you suggest measures such as mask wearing and social distancing from other tables. save your time and $ and do not go here.",1.0,2021-12-22 00:16:00,"[[0.8663689494132996, 0.13209429383277893, 0.001536673167720437]]"

also, we had a 5pm reservation, but we were running late. i called before our reservation to let them know we were running about 20 minutes late. the girl i talked to said our reservation would be canceled after 15 min, but we could try walking in even though they were fully booked. fair enough if that's the policy, but she was on the border of being rude as she told me this. we almost didn't go, but then decided to try it. we were seated after just a short wait, so it wasn't too bad. but the girl on the phone could use some additional training on how to speak with customers.",4.0,2021-12-30 03:04:00,"[[0.663567304611206, 0.3300326466560364, 0.0064001139253377914]]"

the hotel i am staying at has a discount with several restaurants, it is during a pandemic, so we had a slight discount that made it very nice.

3607,"my friend and i were excited to try a new restaurant for dinner prior to a concert at the meyerhoff. we were pleasantly surprised by the decor and ambiance of the revival hotel. it presents an energetic and inviting location for the topside restaurant situated at the top of the hotel. at the top, the restaurant has great views of mt. vernon, the washington monument, and other cityscapes. we were greeted very nicely by the friendly hostess and our server and seated by a window with a beautiful view of the monument -- all decked out in its christmas lights. the menu looked intriguing but offered a few disappointments. the cocktail that i ordered was virtually tasteless (and it had the word ""fire"" in its name). the server offered to try get the bartender to make it right. even the correction was very watered down tasting. when we asked for bread while we waited for our entrees, we were told it came at a charge. ($5 for a 3""x4"" slice of foccacia or $14 for a bread basket. then our orders arrived, the food was very tasty. my friend noted how tender her ribeye was. it came with arugula tossed in vinaigrette. roasted brussel sprouts had to be ordered as a side. i ordered chilean sea bass, which was also tasty, but *tiny*. it looked like an appetizer. i kid you not. the serving of fish was the size of 2 (peeled) grapefruit sections. the two pieces were stacked on top of 14 cup of spinach, on top of a formed serving of rice (which was supposed to be a shrimp rice cake--but i couldn't detect a hint of shrimp). needless to say, i left there still as hungry as i came. i wish the venue well. it is a lovely spot and i would never discourage anyone from patronizing it, but beware of the chilean sea bass as an entree. it's not enough for a typical adult.",3.0,2021-12-06 03:00:00,"[[0.004771793261170387, 0.27284809947013855, 0.7223801016807556]]"

what a remarkable, inviting and comfortable work of art in renovating this old worn down ""motel"" into a destination featuring dining in a setting where i think i may be in tuscany!
our server ""ruth"" was just perfect from attentiveness, knowledge, and mostly, ensuring we had a true dining experience. their wine list is extensive as well as their house cocktails, ruth was also knowledgeable about them, we started with evian water and a bottle of cab we had never tasted - great recommendation
my partner is gluten free ""gf"" and the menu certainly accommodated that in addition to an array of non gf items. the soup, burrata, salad, and the tasmanian steak..it did truly melt in my mouth. ruth advised us to keep some room for ""dessert"" - the butterscotch dessert was the bomb, and we had two others, all ending with an ""al fogato"" and a special ""happy anniversary"" topper on our desserts.
the main dining area is ""roofless"" and the evening was perfect. there was a gentle breeze, and the patio heaters, reflecting pool and other diners created a special vibe.

3762,"pros: break down of delta f2f interview you are being interviewed by flight attendants and other hr recruitment will be in the back watching your every move. you arrive they split you into 3 groups each group is assigned a task. one group will do their f2f, the other group will have a q&a where if you're wanting the job ask as many questions as possible. during this section they will be doing a jump seat test where the belt is only about 18 in around (smaller than a regular airplane seatbelt) but there are bigger people as fa don't let that scare you. and a test to see if you can reach the the storage cabins on a boeing 737. the 3rd group will be doing a cart activity where you need to read the instructions in full, delegate who does what, work and talk as a team, they don't give you any feedback the entire time so you're just guessing, you're putting on the drinks, ice trays, snacks and lunches there even is a peanut allergy so watch that. (it's only a 10 minute exercise work fast) they give you no instructions other than to read the paper. (google what an airline cart looks like). after all task are completed they break you down into zones 1, 2, and 3 if your are escorted out in the first group you didn't get it, second group is a maybe, and there's group that stays you hit the job you will do your fingerprint and drug test in spot. they give you really good encouraging words but i'd rather have honesty they lie to your face saying wait for an email when they no you didn't get it. training is for 6 weeks and is it $7.25 where you work 50 hours a week. pay after training is $32.50 based on flight hours when the cabin doors close a $2.48 per diem if you are not home or moving and are still on company time. everybody is super fake friendly to the point where they'll compliment your whole outfit but they no you're not the right pick. currently as of november 2022 they only have an offering of the worse airports, you will only work domestic flights as a junior fa as they told us a lot of oklahoma, idaho, south dakota random places like that. so if you're doing it for the thrill and wanting to travel i recommend trying a different airline the senior fa get first grabs of flying abroad. if you live where there isn't any bases you will have to either commute which can lead you to paying for your own hotel if you are left somewhere or taking your days off to travel ahead of time to your base. or to move and there is no moving package it's all on you financially to move. i got all the way to the f2f on my first try and i won't be applying again as you have to wait 6 months. just move on to another airline that promises to have you home every night and have relocation packages. bigger airline name does not mean they are better. cons:would rather have a company tell me the honest truth rather to lie advice to management: be honest with people. this is for anybody wanting to be a flight attendant and get to the face 2 face interview in atl just giving out some pointers.",1.0,2022-11-27 13:32:00,"[[0.003364765318110585, 0.9861088395118713, 0.010526481084525585]]"

we failed epically on most things that day!! by the time we got to covent garden she was tiredhungry and just about done! i booked on line 45 mins before we arrived for the only reservation i could get that afternoon for an outside table. our reservation was at 5pm. we arrived at 4.15 and the hostess was simply amazing! not only did she squeeze us in, but got us a lovely table inside with a plenty of room for madame to curl up in our coats whilst we had a fabulous meal to celebrate our anniversary!

3817,"visited with girlfriends for lunch yesterday 19th june for al fresco lunch.
having read some not so favourable reviews about the outside seating area i was somewhat apprehensive however, from the moment we arrived to the moment we left [and without being rushed off of our table] i cannot fault the experience in any way whatsoever.
if you are a little surprised to find yourself seated in an outside car park which has been 'done up' to accommodate outside dining regulations at the moment, then you are mistaken. the outside area, in normal circumstances, is in fact a small in out access to the rear of the hotel and ballroom entrance. there is plenty of cover overhead, blankets on your seats as you arrive and if you wish, a hot water bottle to keep the elements from settling-in but, not required by all of us yesterday.
the food was excellent, as was the presentation and arrival time for any of the food drink to get to the table. there was a variety of diners, socially distanced from us, all of which seemed to be enjoying an equally pleasant afternoon's dining.
the pandemic and the now recent opening-up has meant that the hospitality industry has had to rethink how it can maximise its offerings and if this temporarily equates to a bit of an alternative al fresco seating area as is currently at the biltmore then, in my book, this is well thought out and without any complaint from six ladies who enjoy fine dining - we are used to eating out at the more established of establishments [when we have been able to] so we know good food service levels.
therefore, please visit the biltmore, it was a lovey occasion, food drink reasonably priced and given its kitchen host, a certain mr atherton, you know before you get there that you will not be disappointed! will definitely visit again even if only for a quick cocktail in one of the rather swanky looking bars lounge areas.

we started walking about 90 minutes prior to our reservation to check out the local shops but it was very cold and we opted to get indoors so we arrived at livia much earlier; imagine our surprise when happy hour was in full swing!
we had a couple of special drinks at the bar (very healthy pours) then sat down for dinner. my wife had chicken limone and i had the shrimp and lobster fra diavolo; our server said the fra diavolo blew everything else away and he was spot-on (my wife has celiacs so conventional pasta is out otherwise she would have had the same).

prior to this fun and games we had ordered three drinks and they got the order for two of them wrong.
i ordered haddock and chips which was a mistake. the batter was not crisp and was a very pale yellow colour. if woodfordes wherry was indeed used in this batter then it was a waste of a good beer. the supposedly triple cooked chips were flabby and even the tartar sauce lacked flavour. pretty much a disaster all round.

1. provide the best tables for those that actually show up for their reservation and do not save those spots for no shows - that is how you got lout of business.
2. replace the poolside seating with actual dining tables or change the menu to be a tapas restaurant instead
3 lower your prices as they charged as if they were vaca but they are a far cry from being in the same league as vaca

restaurant is part of hotel. outdoor tent next to terrace had a wedding party going on with loud music and announcers.
twenty minutes for waitress to come by to take order. wine bottle came quickly.
appetizers were grilled octopus and warm brie with blueberries and pistachio with 4 half slices of bread. octopus was chewy and sticky. brie was great but insufficient bread. we had half of brie left and no bread. attempted to catch the attention of helpers and waitress when the made one of their seldom appearances, to no avail. brie was cold when finally we got someone to get some bread. they brought very dry toasted mini slices of bread.
when clearing dishes we mentioned our disappointment of food and service. waitress blamed covid and new servers undertrained.
table next to us returned their appetizers untouched to kitchen.
lobster ravioli for my wife and grilled salmon fir me.
ravioli were ok not much taste of lobster but were literally drowned in a yellowish cream sauce. my wife left half her ravioli. salmon was over cooked. burn on skin side served burnt side up on a bed of vegetable.
we declined dessert and any further drinks. asked for bill.
30 minutes later they came back asking about desert again and we said we had declined and been eating bill. waitress excused herself and came back with mobile card machine.
covid was again used as excuse for poor performance.

i was with a party of 3 on a sunday afternoon. the plan was to order the 10-course brunch. unfortunately, one person in our party had medical issues so she was only able to order a-la-carte. the waitress informed us that the other two could not possibly order the 10-course brunch. so, instead of us paying $70pp for the brunch, we ended up getting $12 & $16 meals. this doesn't make sense financially for the business.. and i left hungry.

we ordered 3 drinks - 2 zombies and 1 la girl. 30 minutes later the manager came to our table to tell us that they ran out of the mix for the zombie. he offered 2 comped drinks to replace the 2 zombies that were ordered. 15 minutes later the 2 comped drinks came. it took us another 15 minutes to find our waiter to tell him that we were still missing the la girl. my drink finally came out more than an hour later. this was after the comped drinks had come out.
i looked around, several tables who had sat down after us were already getting their entrees. i was livid at the fact that the comped drinks that were ordered after our original drink order was brought before my original order. our water glasses were also very empty..
as for the dine la menu, the ahi tartare and hamachi crudo are delicious! the scallop piccata has huge scallops and so worth it. the proscuitto wrapped chicken was maybe a 610. and the desserts are just okay. the strawberry orange puff has some weird taste that did not set well with all of us (we tossed them) and the brownie..it's just a regular brownie.",4.0,2021-03-06 23:24:00,"[[0.6036108136177063, 0.3909282684326172, 0.005460991058498621]]"

we all ordered something different; chili wings, crab cake sandwich, chicken and shrimp tacos, salmon, cheesesteak rolls, the burger, the short ribs. everything was good and well-portioned except the short ribs, it could've been a little more. the drinks were good and the atmosphere was very nice. kyle was our waiter and he made us feel comfortable and his service was impeccable. i can't wait to go back.",5.0,2021-03-31 05:32:00,"[[0.004768626298755407, 0.8154234290122986, 0.17980799078941345]]"

4675,the food in the hotel was nice and it had free parking which you want in a hotel honestly the whole experience at this hotel was super uncomfortable from the moment we arrived. parking - when you first get to the hotel it was super hard to find the parking area and once you do there is two barricades..i believe both should be down and u need to press a button or code to enter however it was open so although the parking was free it was not secure. arrival- when my partner and i arrived at the hotel it honestly felt like a very outdated hotel however we where there for one night and thought we would give it a chance. when we got to reception neither staff member was wearing masks and no one greated us with a warm welcome again might of been a bad day so could get over it..secondly what tipped it over the edge the guy looked at my partner and saw he was also male and asked u know you booked a double which i said is fine..he then proceeded to ask again u know its a double? i said yes that's grand..when my partner walked up to put in his reg details the man asked a third and final time..u know i can get you a twin room which then my partner replied no we want the double room..i'm sorry but for someone at a hotel to make us feel uncomfortable as soon as we arrived is a joke. also for someone to work in the hospitality industry in 2021 and not be open and welcoming.to all guests no matter who they are is a joke..i just wish i had of walked away then because of the clear homophobia we experienced. cannot believe i gave this hotel my money i'm annoyed at myself for that. in the words of elle woods from legally blond 2 ' i forgot to use my voice.' with the clear homophobia from the start we did not get an 'enjoy ur stay' or anything it was just awkwardness and unfriendliness from the moment we arrived to when we left. resturant - with lockdown restrictions in the south we arrived late at the hotel we had to eat there otherwise it was outdoor dinning..,0.5,2021-07-15 02:00:00,"[[0.8441511988639832, 0.15349861979484558, 0.0023502453695982695]]"

we had the diver guacamole. it was fine. regular guacamole with pumpkin seeds on top. we tried the hamachi ceviche. it was so bad we had to send it back. it wasn't even ceviche. it was more like crudo with a horrid fishy under taste (like it wasn't fresh). we chose to replace it with the vegan ceviche. it was an odd grouping of veggies that didn't pair well. too many flavors that just didn't work together.
the chicken fajitas were tasteless. i would have liked if they had a dollop of guac or some salsa or something to give them depth. oh, and the table chips were bland. missing salt (or something).
our server was terrible. it was just a table of two. she chose not to write our orders down. instead, she had to come back and ask us for our drink order a 2nd time and our appetizer order a 2nd time. the bussers, though, were great. attentive and personable.
i get the restaurant is new, but dinner for 2 at 7:30 should not take 2+ hours when the menu is less than 10 items just repackaged, even with a full house.

4990,"great location in the middle of pitt university!
beautiful new, modern hotel but with some unusual features.
as you walk in on the ground level you will be in a small vestibule with 2 elevators and a small valet stand - there is no lobby in the ground floor.
as you rise to the restaurant on the 10th floor, you'll exit the elevators, where there will be two small counters right in front of the restaurant where you can check in, get your keys and return down to your room.
the restaurant has a great feel with high ceilings, expansive windows offering terrific views of the campus and soldiers and sailors.
the space is well decorated in a modern, industrial chic vibe and the bar is central with a variety of tables to the left, a small outside terrace and comfortable sofas and chairs to the right of the bar.
we hosted a small dinner for six on a friday night recently. the hostess was friendly, accommodating us at a beautiful corner table with great views. the staff was attentive but the service was slow.
the menu seemed limited, a bit boring and confused as it featured summer salads and specials in the middle of november however, the drink menu had seasonal-appropriate, fall-inspires drinks.
the restaurant has some good standards and staples on the menu such as french onion soup, the burger, roasted chicken and the mushroom ravioli, all priced in the high teens to mid $30s. if you want a steak, be prepared to pay in the $60s for two options.
overall, really nice space, decor and views but unimpressed and underwhelmed by the menu selections, the service the and value delivered.",3.0,2021-12-09 01:07:00,"[[0.001880224677734077, 0.9757855534553528, 0.022334184497594833]]"

5056,"this is a lovely old inn and we'd heard so much about mark hix. we were really looking forward to our lunch.
we had booked for the evening, but cancelled this booking and booked for lunch. we thought driving through dorset lanes in the dark might be a little dicey.
young servers attended to us, who did not have a good knowledge of the menu and struggled when asked questions. servers need to be trained. i suspect this again is a case of cheap wages in hospitality, which is not acceptable for any restaurant. we did feel sorry for these servers.
now for the food. the monkfish was tough. how can that be, but it was. my wife's brill was pink, not good and her scallops were rather like leather.
i don't know whether to laugh or cry at this! we were charged a 1 each for the jug of tap water. really! if mark hix is this desperate, then i'm at a loos.
finally, although we had cancelled the evening booking online and asked our server to confirm, i received an email from opentable chastising us for not cancelling. i've explained to opentable it was cancelled. this again does not bode well for the fox inn.

we got the pine-abbey express and hudson royale. both were fantastic. the bartender picked us an excellent red to go with our entrees. i don't remember the name.
finally, for dessert, we splurged and got the pane cotta, the gelato (olive oil, coffee, risotto were the flavors of the day), the olive oil cake and the chocolate tort.
winners were definitely the olive oil gelato and olive oil cake. absolutely divine. i'd never had olive oil desserts and was blown away.

5096,"brand new, the hotel is stylish without being intimidating, restaurant has yet (8th september) to open outside terrace, which could make it a fabulous venue.
staff are very friendly and efficient, training for the opening has obviously been thorough and they have recruited well.
kevin our server was superb.
the burrata, light and creamy, the orange dressing lacked acidity for me but my partner loved it.
fondue, couldn't fault it, rich, melting, nutty sweet, sharp and tangy.
lamb cutlets cooked perfectly, pink and moist, delicious.
turbot, very generous portion, we both found the chilli detracted from the flavour of the fish as the star of the dish, personal taste?
haricots, very large portion, otherwise perfectly cooked and seasoned.
we were desperate to try the mille feuille, but could not eat another thing.
wines were reasonable starting at 10 a glass, and available as 500ml carafes, the mucadet was clean, fresh, fruitier than expected, the rhone cairanne was beautiful, rich and smooth with red and black berry fruits.
the background mucic wasn't to our taste, sometimes making it hard to hear our server, and they are obviously coming to terms with lighting as the sun disappears, understandable in such a new venue.

every member of staff from the doormen to our amazing server maria were professional, attentive, knowledgeable and took time to genuinely get to know us and our preferences.
maria spent much time to advise us on the menu options as did the sommaelier which resulted in an exceptional meal from start to finish.
the food was a twist on some classic french and italian dishes with outstanding flavour, texture and presentation. cooked to perfection and served with style.
maria and team then booked us the perfect table in the stage bar (and transferred our bill seamlessly) for us to enjoy after dinner drinks and live music.
the talented adam and alex did a number of terrific sets and took requests. they also like the other staff made time to meet and chat with us. all the while the bar staff served us (few too many our bad) cocktails.
the hotel has stunning interiors, outstanding fooddrink and a great location.
but the reason we're coming back is the people.
all staff are hands down best in class here in london.
just one of our best nights out in 2 years honestly.
our thanks.

(i had informed the accommodation of our pending arrival and it had been acknowledged so you'd have thought they would check the parking situation) we had to stop on the cycle lane to unpack our bags and a passing pedestrian had a row with my husband about it, although he could see i was frantically unpacking our luggage from the boot. my husband then had to rejoin the nose-to-tail traffic to find out where to park. once in the accommodation, i then tried to express to the girl that we fairly urgently needed to see if the guest was around to move the car but she kept saying 'she thought he was and she would ask' but then proceeded to ask for payment etc before she checked to see if the guy was available, and all the while my poor husband is driving around in rush hour traffic clueless as to whether he needs to find parking elsewhere or not. the car was finally moved, my husband was able to come back and we got parked. the room was clean but very poky. the bed was tiny and like a torture device, and 3 days later my back is still sore. it was brick hard, and you could feel the springs. the duvet was really heavy, so very hot, but if you threw it off, there was just a sheet, so you then froze. the pillows were so thin as to be virtually non-existant. and the whole place reeked like someone had boiled dry a pan of potatoes. i'd rather crawl over a dead body than stay there again",1.5,2021-10-04 02:00:00,"[[0.9247240424156189, 0.07229500263929367, 0.002980984514579177]]"

5639,"the ambiance on the rooftop is great! beautiful views, with fire pits available if you're feeling a little chilly. we were late meeting our reservation, but were still seated right away which was nice. our waiter, augustine, was very friendly, however, he would be mia for long periods at a time. i try to be understanding of that, because i know many places are suffering from worker shortages in this postintra-covid world we live in. i was a bit disappointed that i had specified in our reservation that we were there to celebrate a birthday, but at no point during our dining experience did anyone on staff acknowledge or inquire about that. my biggest source of discontent was with regard to the menu. i am vegan, and ordered the chilaquiles (hold the sour cream) only for my meal to arrive smothered in cheese. please note that cheese is not listed as an ingredient in the item description. so i sent it back and requested it be replaced with the beyond burger, which i waited hungrily for while the remainder of my party ate. when the beyond burger came, it appeared to have a creamy sauce, but i just ate it any way, as i had already waited too long. i think the staff could benefit from some basic education on veganism (that holds true for a lot of establishments), so that they know when to disclose information about certain dishes which may be mistaken as vegan at first glance. aside from that, and slow service at times, it wasn't a bad experience. and the drinks were great! def my favorite part.",3.0,2021-12-09 18:52:00,"[[0.016180485486984253, 0.5331682562828064, 0.45065125823020935]]"

it is unfortunate that customers overstay their allotted time to dine. it's great that you want to enjoy time with your family or friends, but, it's thanksgiving day. there are other customers waiting. if you need more time, get up and go into the bar area or rent a room at the restaurant. it's common sense and common courtesy.
i took off 1 star for the service in the bar before dinner. the bartender was overwhelmed. i don't have an issue with someone unable to handle the work load. i have an issue with the managements inability to recognize what is happening and send in someone to help the bartender cleanup, restock, etc. while the bartender waits in customers.
the view was amazing!! the restaurant is on the second floor, with the entry and bar on the first level. the view is just over the tops of the trees and looking onto the crescent rose hotel.

5924,"the building was nice, interesting that you can walk about and have opportunities for interesting pictures and stuff.
food tasted nice, but it was just too little portions. the menu could benefit from being bigger and also giving the options of bigger portion sizes- the price for the steak for just getting a steak was poor. you could get a steak with the extras you would usually expect to be there for the same price somewhere else, and the peppercorn sauce was really salty.
the service wasn't ideal. we were asked what we would like to drink (both says strawberry daiquiris) and offered table water. 15 mins went past and still no table water. we were then informed 5 minutes after our initial wait for drinks that there wasn't any strawberry daiquiris available; and this is at 20 to 7 on a friday night.. again that's not great. we had finished our meals by the time any form of drink had arrived at our table.
we got our final bill, and we weren't made aware that it was 50% off on all food. this was a nice and welcome surprise, but had we have known that in advance, we probably would have ordered more food and thus not had to get something back at the hotel later on.",2.0,2022-01-22 13:05:00,"[[0.504202663898468, 0.4931437075138092, 0.002653619972988963]]"

5926,"first off the food is amazing. no issues there, menu well explained by staff and came in good time.
however this restaurant lets itself down badly with seating. i booked online and asked for the best available table, when we got there we were sat in a thoroughfare room off the main restaurant. the seats were soft so it was like i was sitting on the floor and we were up against a solid wall to my immediate right which turned out to be the kitchen.
with spaces throughout we identified another table and asked to sit there. this had to be checked. then is was deemed permissible!
we were still however in an area where the hotel guest came and went as this restaurant is within a hotel complex. we saw guests in robes walking by from the spa, a group of golfers with clubs walked past our table to return to their room and various other comings and goings. when they have a specific restaurant with empty tables this was all unnecessary and a bit weird!
we didnt get their best available table and my advice when booking here is to specify you want to eat in the restaurant, not the foyer area. the food was exceptional though but the wine extremely pricey even for faux edinburgh prices (9.10) for a small malborough sb for example is extortionate.
we would eat there again but only if i was certain we would be in the main restaurant area.",2.0,2021-09-12 22:22:00,"[[0.41705605387687683, 0.5568206906318665, 0.026123251765966415]]"

6185,"wayfarer rooftop 10-course brunch was horrible!! everyone in the restaurant was complaining. it was supposed to be a family brunch to celebrate my daughter's 21st birthday but we waited 45 minutes for our reservation. then we were put in the sun instead of the table we reserved. and the service was so awful it was unbelievable. i told the waiter i had a fatal allergy to nuts and he empathized saying he has the same allergy but my food came out with nuts. they brought my husband the complete wrong food and by the time they brought his food the other five of us were all done. they didn't bring water to the tables and guests were going to the bar to get their own. my daughter had to go to the bar to order drinks since our waiter never came by. they took our silverware between courses but didn't bring new silverware. and the 10-course fix-price menu comes with a final round of frozen wine drinks that never came. after waiting another 30 minutes we just left. we asked for a to-go box for the dessert but the waiter never brought the box so we left it. do not go. it will ruin your special occasion. i have never been so disappointed by a restaurant on a special occasion and am so sad for my daughter.

the food didn't quite live up to expectations and felt it was overpriced.
we ordered four mains of which 2 were fish . sea bass and john dory both of which were very good. there was a halloumi burger and fries which was very good also. then there was the vegetarian wellington , well we could hardly see it on the plate and to call it a mains was very over stated. we should really have sent it back and asked for a mains not a starter!! apparently it was tasty but were very glad they ordered a side of chips.
the wine ordered was excellent and the service was exceptional.
the sweets were on the whole poor. there was a strawberry creame patisserie which was sloppy and the chocolate ganache was very good but it came with a separate hazelnut cake which was not worth putting on the plate. the pineapple dessert was the star of the show.
on the whole would i recommend the candlelight inn? yes as long as you choose wisely. except you can't because you don't know what you're going to get. but if you are going for lovely ambiance a nice afternoon out , give it a go and you might choose well.

- turns out there were vegan options, they weren't on the menu. our friend ordered the vegan soup and was bought out the non vegan option
- we informed the waiter they had served the wrong soup, the waiter accused us of not being able to tell the difference in colour (they bought a grey mushroom soup, we ordered a butternut squash soup)
- when the butternut squash soup arrived it had a dollop of yoghurt in it (not vegan)
- we asked for bread and olive oil for the table - they said they were too busy for this (the restaurant was not full and there were waiting staff doing nothing)
- 2 jaffa cake desserts ordered, they were terrible and looked shop bought

the downfall of this place is the service. not the waiting time for the food or drinks, but the attitude of the servers. from once we walked in the hostess was blah (not welcoming, sort of like your dam lucky to be here attitude). our waitress was the least friendly of anyone we have come across in maui, i thought we were at a truck stop diner with her demeanor. the only person that was friendly was he server that brought us appetizers.
once our entrees came we were told if we wanted dessert to let her (our waitress) know asap because it takes 15 minutes to make it ""ok sweetie"". like wtf!
so , if you want some really great food!! go here. but expect truck stop service and attitude if you get the same people as we did.

6631,terra tempe is a nice restaurant in downtown tempe based in the westin hotel off 7th street. it was not fun to park as we had to pay $18 for the valet or find a space on the street if we wanted to park close for 4 bucks. i feel this is an impediment to people going to the terra tempe restaurant as it limits parking especially for the dinner service. our waiter was very nice and attentive and the food was very good. noise level was also nice and we had a good time catching up over our meal. the menu is somewhat expensive and i would imagine they lose customers to the parking issues during the dinner hour. i don't know that i would eat here again even though the food and service was very nice. i imagine most of their business comes from hotel guests only.,4.0,2022-03-08 12:02:00,"[[0.5882660746574402, 0.4033157229423523, 0.008418244309723377]]"

6904,"we booked the limanaki fish restaurant to enjoy a wonderful seafood experience for my birthday. given the heat in cyprus, it is surprising that upon request there were no fans available, only at certain locations. as a 5-start hotel, the staff should place greater effort in ensuring the comfort of guests and make certain there are enough outlets for fans. it was extremely hot and we had to sit in discomfort, eventually having to move due to the heat, nearer to the fans. furthermore, we looked forward to trying the crispy fried baby prawns, only to be informed that they were not available. we do not come to a gourmet restaurant specialising in seafood to be told that there are no baby prawns available. the enjoyment of our food was also limited due to a lot of disturbance by cats and children who were feeding and causing further disruption around us. allowing children to feed animals food with utensils and giving them water in glasses that your clients eat and drink from is completely unacceptable, not to mention unhygienic. a staff member should have intervened. overall, it was not the experience we expected to enjoy at an award winning gourmet fish restaurant, and we left unimpressed and disappointed.",3.0,2021-07-02 11:39:00,"[[0.18571893870830536, 0.7948916554450989, 0.019389400258660316]]"

7108,"we loved our thanksgiving dinner at the deauville. our waiterbartender ryan was wonderful. he makes a stellar martini. this may sound ridiculous but the turkey was the best turkey i have ever eaten - full of flavor and moist. the she crab soup and stuffing were my second favorites. the only bad thing we had to say was that we weren't offered any mashed potatoes with the thanksgiving platter special.
the sunset over the bay was spectacular.
i was very impressed by our meal and the staff especially in light of the fact that we are in off season and with the staff shortages in the world right now the owners and management should be proud of their staff.
kudos to the chefs and staff !!
as i said on our way out - thank you for working so that we could enjoy ourselves on thanksgiving.
my advice for those that have never been - run don't walk to the deauville inn.

7125,"i'll start with saying the food was very good, which is why this review gets 3 stars. my compliments to the kitchen staff. however, the service and ambiance were subpar. this restaurant is in the lobby of the canopy hotel. like, in a wide-open corner of the lobby, so it's more like a typical hotel bar than a restaurant, which we didn't know when booking. it has an outdoor patio, but no interesting views, just a street corner. after being seated on the patio we waited for 5+ minutes without service, until the hostess came back over to tell us ""sorry for the wait, your server is still in the bathroom"". ok..thanks..and gross. when waiter finally showed we ordered drinks and food at the same time and let him know we'd take the check whenever as we had a show nearby to catch in 45 minutes. we were still waiting on drinks 10+ minutes later when the waiter brought the appetizer and said ""oh, i thought someone else brought you your drinks from the bar, i'll go get them now."" thanks. the waiter was overly casual and generally unmotivated. sign of the times i suppose, with good service difficult to find in the restaurant industry. we won't be going back to cobre kitchen, though if we find ourselves in the area again we may check out outrider rooftop lounge on the roof of the canopy hotel. we overheard guests having a cocktail on the patio of cobre kitchen while they waited for their table at outrider say the rooftop lounge had much better views and ambiance, and i would only have to imaginehope better service.",3.0,2021-12-09 00:23:00,"[[0.4306643307209015, 0.5506469011306763, 0.018688704818487167]]"

once we did get to our table, eventually, way behind the schedule we'd make based on our un-honored ""reservation"" time, we were greeted with a sick kid coughing continually next to us. not something a restaurant and hotel geared towards small kids, many of which cannot be vaccinated, should be tolerating. ask those parents to get room service, offer to cover it instead of the buffet.. something.
on top of all that, the food was mediocre at best.. definitely not a good value for what they charge. better spots in the park.

7879,"first time here, we wanted to give it a try and experience the steakhouse in the heart of old scottsdale. if it were not for the efforts of manager kenny and gm german we would have given this one star at most. note *scottsdale has a plethora of really great steak houses to choose from. they all have unique ambience and cater to their own specific crowd.
however from the moment you enter stk you get the sense of the crowd they cater to is tourist, bachelorettes and the single older guy crowd. be prepared to wait 40 to 60 minutes even with a reservation. we had a 6 o'clock reservation and were told to go to the bar. after 20 minutes my husband was fuming. after 30 minutes he was ready to leave. kenny the manager offered to buy us a drink at the bar which went a long way towards alleviating the situation. after 45 minutes we were told our table was finally ready.
keep in mind that the main dining room is very small. not many people can be seated at this restaurant. i'm not sure what they can do about this but it seems at the bar area is the main way that stk serves their patrons. we sat down and ordered drinks, a 10 ounce fillet and my husband requested a special short rib mac & cheese. after the waitress said it would be extra $30 we said fine. what got sent out was a mac & cheese with maybe two scant pieces of short rib on it. so unbelievably stingy. in addition, the fillet was not 10 ounces it looked much smaller.
it was at this time that the general manager, german walked over. he literally saved the entire night. he spent time talking with us about our experience and wanted to make sure the food issues were addressed. german has worked at the wynn hotel amongst many other upscale places and as a result he brings an enormous amount of experience and sophistication to stk. he made sure a side plate of short what was sent over and a proper steak in addition. i feel that under germans guidance stk can become a more upscale scottdale destination.",4.0,2021-11-15 00:02:00,"[[0.05225498974323273, 0.9251174330711365, 0.02262752875685692]]"

8020,"avoid rooftop at wayfarer hotel dtla. i took my wife there for a special lunch date and we had a very bad experience. it started off with the hostess whose first words to me were to demand ""what's the name on the reservation?"" no hello, no welcome. she looked so stressed and unhappy. she got us seated where we waited 10 mins for a server to arrive. when he did he was carrying a stack of water glasses, enough for all the tables who had been waiting for him, with the top water glass tucked under his chin. he had a mask on but it was down around his neck so he was breathing into the stack of glasses his customers would be drinking from. nasty. he apologized for leaving us for so long without water on a hot day and left the *empty* water glasses on our table to give out the remaining glasses to others. the server also looked unhappy and like he wished he could be anywhere else but at work. he came back about 5 mins later with water bottles for the tables in our area, again carrying several in such a way that he was breathing into the open bottles. he finally came back to take our order later, and we were seriously thinking about just leaving. we went ahead and ordered though, and asked the server to bring us some clean glasses, since the ones he had brought us had someone's lipstick on them. also nasty. the tables around us had umbrellas at this rooftop restaurant, but they had neglected to purchase bases for the umbrellas, so they flopped around every time the wind blew. one of them came within inches of my wife's head - i had to grab it in flight to stop it from hitting her. one of the other tables complained about the umbrella problem which caused the manager to come over. he told the gentlemen at that table that he was doing the best he could but there was nothing he could do about the lack of bases. he said ""you can either have the umbrellas or sit in the sun."" from this we knew that all the employees there are miserable. avoid rooftop at wayfarer hotel dtla!",1.0,2021-09-07 20:22:00,"[[0.9466054439544678, 0.04979037120938301, 0.0036041927523911]]"

, so to be seated by an open door with annoying flies and in the noisiest half of the restaurant was disappointing. i don't think it's incumbent upon me to specify what kind of disability a guest has, the request should be processed using common sense. also, our two guests walked in unchallenged through the open door near our table, without their temperature being taken or any contact details. the food was reasonable, the steak was good i have to say, but as our first restaurant meal in nearly two years, the final bill did resonate as an effort to claw back lost revenue from last year, a fish pie at 13.95 with no sides? my dad recommended bill's to us as our daughter is soon moving to lewes and it would have been a great introduction to the town. i'm left feeling a bit deflated with the whole experience, as what was intended to be a quiet but celebratory meal for a completed degree, finished with our first thought afterwards being what could we get to eat on the way back to our hotel.",2.0,2021-06-27 13:25:00,"[[0.10788439959287643, 0.8897955417633057, 0.0023200283758342266]]"

the downside to dining outside is the heaters. unfortunately, the heaters are small, limited extension cords which kept ours far from the four diners. our reservation was for 5:45, we were promptly seated but the heater did not keep us from the cold. would have liked to sample the dessert menu but the cold won out.
strongly suggest a better heating option for those in the hotel entrance. the wind swirls about negating the limited effect these heaters from mitigating the cold.

8438,"this restaurant is in the lobby of the canopy hotel. i highlight that because it is literally in the lobby, and this played a role in the experience we had.
we made reservations for the new years eve dinner at $110 per person (prepaid). it was a set three course menu and sparkling wine toast. a little expensive, but it was new years eve.
it took 10 minutes for someone to bring water. 5 more minutes for the waiter to introduce himself and his trainee (training on new years eve??). we ordered drinks and it took another 10 minutes to get them. the waiter didn't take any time to set up the experience or explain the menu, just asked for our order. there were three courses with three to four choices on each course. he also told us we needed to order everything at once, which felt a bit rushed, but he said they would pace the courses. we selected a barley and roast beef soup and a swedish meatball plate for appetizers. both came out cold. the barley was undercooked and there was no seasoning at all. no salt and pepper on the table either. meatballs were bland as well. when asked if we enjoyed it, we said no and were offered another choice of the final option, a bruschetta, which was fine.
the entre was a petite filet for me and a lobster tail for my wife. they were both tasty and cooked well, but the portion was tiny. the filet was maybe 4 oz and the lobster was just a few bites. we were not asked if we wanted more wine when our glasses were empty, and instead had to ask the waiter. also, at this point a group of guests sat at the hotel bar table directly behind us and were so loud, my wife and i could not hear each other. it stayed that way until the end.
dessert was dry and in fact my wife's was burnt. the waiter never asked again if we enjoyed our food. our champagne took two requests to receive. overall, a new years we will never forget. unfortunately.
almost $300 after drinks and tip.. way too much for the experience we had.",1.0,2022-01-06 18:55:00,"[[0.0011078553507104516, 0.981884241104126, 0.017007920891046524]]"

8451,"we have not been to the bedford post inn since the farmhouse closed. so when we got an email about valentines day dinner at the barn, we thought it would be nice. we sat upstairs, which is quieter than downstairs. it was also warmer as the door to the outside was downstairs and it was 16 degrees last night.
our table was a good size and the seating was comfortable. other guests were spaced in a way that we could not hear the people next to us, and hopefully they would say the same.
the menu was a six course prix- fix meal. three appetizers: hama hama oysters (3) followed by ricotta panna cotta, then foie gras. the mains (2) were bay scallops with black truffle, sun-choke, black walnut and pepper cress, and wegu steak with smoked potato, jus and mustard greens. desert was triple chocolate; dark, milk, and white raspberry.
the food was delicious and nicely presented. we were not rushed. the waitstaff was attentive, but not intrusive. it was not noisy and we could talk and hear each other with ease.
there are few good restaurants in northern westchester. we eat at crabtree kittle house regularly. when the farmhouse was open we ate there regularly as well. they had problems with the kitchen and staff in the past. i hope our experience on valentines day will be a harbinger of future quality food and enjoyable dining at the bedford post inn.

the food in my opinion is delicious, my teenagers say the steak is the best they have ever tasted.
however as a wedding catering chef myself i am always wary to recommend food on any forum since the majority of people who chose to write reviews often focus on the negative and not the positive.
unforeseen circumstances are always going to occur in any kitchen, catering or hospitality industry and for me it's not so much about the food but how problems are dealt with when and if they arise.

we expected a great view, but also received excellent service and food. the front desk was efficient and friendly, and were shown to our balcony table right on time. table service followed by a super friendly server, who watched over us the entire meal. we found all of our appetizers and entrees very good, served timely and hot as appropriate. as expected for waikiki the pricing is high, but at least service and food were well done throughout the meal.

8864,"location, but plenty of better hotels in a similar location. the restaurant was under whelming. firstly we asked to be placed by the window as the seat we were brought to wasn't great at all, but we were told the window table was reserved (after our waiter went to check), we thought that was fair enough. but literally 5 minutes later another couple came in to be placed in a seat in front of us. they asked to be seated at the window instead and the manager said ""sure of course"". this was only one annoying thing to start our evening. i ordered the burger and chips, which was only ok and 25e? we ordered white wine, it was honestly room temperature and very overpriced.. we moved to the bar, and were told that our order would be taken in 5 minutes, 25 minutes later they took our order and we waited another 15 minutes for the drinks to arrive - not over exaggerating it was 40 minutes waiting with no drink. obviously with covid restrictions we could not order at the bar ourselves but it appeared there was only one girl making drinks for the whole bar. she was trying her best and super friendly even though she was obviously very under pressure. i understand there's teething problems with places reopening after the lockdown but when paying a lot for a hotel, dinner and drinks (prices much higher than average dublin prices which are already high), you atleast expect the service to be good. the last straw for us was that our room was piping hot! so much warmer than it was outside even with the air con on the lowest. we told the woman at reception about the room when checking out and she took the price of parking off our room. given that we spent over 400e in the hotel for our one night stay we were just so so disappointed with the poor standard.",2.0,2021-06-06 02:00:00,"[[0.8451853394508362, 0.15010440349578857, 0.004710243083536625]]"

starter was ok, as was sweet .but main course was dire. ordered fish and chips, but my fish in particular was thick with soggy batter penetrating through it , more batter than fish., and barely digestable. husbands was better and had more fish. but he was disappointed that we had dry, frozen chips , and both of us left a lot on the plate. however our waiter was too busy schmoozing hotel guests (and moaning about his pay ) that he left us with the plates for ages and then never even bothered to ask how it was despite it being obvious we hadn't enjoyed it! so i had to make a point of saying it wasn't good and he said he'd ""speak to the chef""., but offered no apology. we heard no more when he came to give us sweet menu,; he kept approaching table with mask under his nose (!) and when serving sweet nearly poked me in the eye with my plate as he served my husband first . we then had to struggle to catch his attention to get those plates cleared and ask for bill (after waiting well over 15 mins).when he presented bill to us i had to ask what the response of the chef had been at which point he burbled some rubbish about fish coming in different sizes (!! -strange i thought they were all identical ?!!), and that was why it could come out differently, and still never apologised. (we doubt he ever spoke to the chef.). nothing was taken off the bill to compensate for our poor experience and nor did they mark the fact it was booked as my husbands birthday meal in anyway.

i don't know why i was ignored, nor am i positive that i was even in the correct spot, as zero signage. clear signage, a clear demarcation of entrance area to the seating area, and being clearly acknowledged upon entrance would help people know if they were in the right spot. too bad that i didn't get to try the food. it looked interesting. disappointing.",1.0,2022-03-12 09:09:00,"[[0.07740417867898941, 0.919223427772522, 0.003372300649061799]]"

we failed epically on most things that day!! by the time we got to covent garden she was tiredhungry and just about done! i booked on line 45 mins before we arrived for the only reservation i could get that afternoon for an outside table. our reservation was at 5pm. we arrived at 4.15 and the hostess was simply amazing! not only did she squeeze us in, but got us a lovely table inside with a plenty of room for madame to curl up in our coats whilst we had a fabulous meal to celebrate our anniversary!
the food was outstandingservice impeccable and the staff were so understanding! i took my main course home in a takeout bag and ate it at the hotel but that was so not their fault! it was to stop the monumental meltdown that was about to occur!

another problem is that we wished to order wine but asked for some guidance on finding a choice compatible with our meals. the server said he would get the sommelier to help us, but when heshe never came to our table and we had already finished our starters i reminded the server we wanted to get the sommelier's guidance in choosing between 3 different varietals. after several more minutes the server said the sommelier wasn't coming over to our table but instead sent a message in favor of one of the wines we were considering.

we waited about 12 hour from being seated for someone to come and take our order. my partner went direct to the bar to get a drink and was served instantly.
the starter came out about 20 minutes later however there was about a 40minute wait between starter and main.
when the main arrived the cauliflower cheese i ordered was cold in the centre and after a couple of bites of the chicken pie i found a bone so the rest of the meal i was unable to finish.
the staff offered me a complementary drink and originally discounted the meal but 50% i had to push for the meal to be on the house which was a shame considering the overall experience that we had.

the sunday roast was generally good but there were a couple of things that could be improved. the beef was exceptionally pink to the point of being raw which was okay for me but would not suit everyone and the only other option we were given was 'well done'. my mother took that option but was disappointed to find that the beef had been sliced and pan fried which left an unpleasant after taste and texture. the large yorkshire puddings looked impressive but were over cooked. these were small things overall that could easily be improved.
the wine list was decent but i had to ask for a drinks menu.

10131,"i have been to this new milo's restaurant twice now. first time for lunch and second for dinner. i had a calamari starter followed by wild salmon with potatoes, broccoli and asparagus. all were very palatable, veggies were delightfully not overcooked. my choices were pretty safe so i cannot comment further. i ordered their baklava purely to check how authentic they were. it was delicious with just enough honey ( maybe a tad more for me ) and the filo pastry was light but again, could have been drenched more but i think this is a personal preference rather than the guideline. my partner ordered a ""chocolate sin"" which had no description whether it was a mousse, soufle or something else. it was something else. not too sure how i would describe this triangle cut thinnish looking slab of chocolate. tasting this i still wasn't sure what it was, cake it wasn't, cheesecake no, soufle it definitely was not. it was a thick flour less hardish slice of chocolate that had obviously been tempered with maybe eggs and cream or yogurt then poured to set. it stuck to the roof of my mouth, full on with chocolate but not in a good way for me. i'm sure chocky lovers will delight in this dessert but sadly not for me. the side of raspberries were needed to enhance the dish. overall this is a beautiful restaurant with delightful staff who are attentive especially marcus. the display of fresh fish, shellfish and veggies was very pretty. it is expensive but you are in a 5 star hotel complex. it is not 5 star fine dining but great for a good fish lunch or dinner ( by the way their 3 course lunch menu is just $38 which is marvellous ). our meal without wine was $ 330 without 20% tip.",4.0,2021-05-04 21:53:00,"[[0.023968100547790527, 0.4905218183994293, 0.48551008105278015]]"

the biscuits and gravy were delicious. huge portions. i was extremely excited for the tots but was very disappointed w the flavor. it struck me as odd. the aioli was so flavorful though. the pancakes were very good but it would be helpful to have sugar free syrup due to diabetic patrons. mimosas were great, heavy on champagne. coffee was good. tasted a lot like french press.
