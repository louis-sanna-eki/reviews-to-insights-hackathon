was a little dark around our table so i could not see the contents of the broth. nonetheless it was lovely. mains were, sea bass for my partner and steak for me. again both were fantastic but i must mention that i was expecting chips with my steak. it did come with a form of chips which were cleverly layered strips of potato that were deep fried. very interesting. the whole experience was great and when chef, mark hix sauntered over for a chat it just made the evening more special. the fact that it appears that all ingredients are sourced from local producers makes it even better, apart from some wines, obviously.\nwe will be back again soon.","metadata":{"source":"data/raw/reviews.csv","line":1717}}],["1717",{"pageContent":"docs|rating|timestamp: a lovely setting alongside the

energetic conversation.\nnow for the food. mediterranean cuisine focuses on fresh, simple flavors like lemon, garlic, and sesame. ema took the art form to its highest level. i can honestly say i have never tasted better mediterranean food in my life, nor have i had a better meal downtown.\nthe eggplant spread comes served with warm and irresistible pita bread, toasted to perfection and sprinkled with persian spices. the cauliflower is artistically plated with greek yogurt and a subtle touch of honey to complement the fresh crunch of vegetable.\nemma's house specialty--the brussel sprouts--are sweetly glazed, charred, and tossed with pumpkin seeds. most everyone has eaten brussel sprouts before, but you have never tasted them like this.\ni quite recommend the mushroom kabob for the rich grilled portobellos and pungent, pesto-like sauce served on the side. i would love to ask chef cj jacobson where the syrupy, date-and-fig-like flavor on this dish came from.\nfor carnivores, the beef kabob is seasoned generously with what tasted like turmeric, parsley, and onion--just like a traditional middle eastern kofta grill of meat. but save room for dessert! the honey pie (see picture attached) is handsomely presented with a dollop of home-made whipped cream, sweet candied red grapes (which were addictive; i could have eaten a whole bowl of those alone), and a garnish of sesame seeds. the dish was every bit as sweet and satisfying as it sounds.\nthe staff here are very friendly, and service is quick. as for me, i have found my new favorite place to eat in chicago

ordered our food and my sister ordered seafood moules, they came as white wine moules, she questioned this with the waitress who stated the seafood is there (she checked, it wasn't), she then raised this with someone else who said he would check with the chef, he never came back, she raised this a third time with the waitress who took our order and she accused my sister of ordering the wrong dish and she didn't order seafood which was not acceptable service; so we had to call on someone else, again and finally it got changed. to have to ask 4 times that it's the wrong dish and for it to be changed is not an acceptable service.\nwe then felt we had to call upon waitresseswaiters constantly as we felt they were avoiding our table.\nfinally we got our plates cleared and not once did we get offered a dessert menu, we had to ask. we finally ordered and when the puddings came out we had no cutlery so yet again, we had to ask. the waiter then came back with teaspoons, not dessert spoons so

the meyerhoff. we were pleasantly surprised by the decor and ambiance of the revival hotel. it presents an energetic and inviting location for the topside restaurant situated at the top of the hotel. at the top, the restaurant has great views of mt. vernon, the washington monument, and other cityscapes. we were greeted very nicely by the friendly hostess and our server and seated by a window with a beautiful view of the monument -- all decked out in its christmas lights. the menu looked intriguing but offered a few disappointments. the cocktail that i ordered was virtually tasteless (and it had the word \"fire\" in its name). the server offered to try get the bartender to make it right. even the correction was very watered down tasting. when we asked for bread while we waited for our entrees, we were told it came at a charge. ($5 for a 3\"x4\" slice of foccacia or $14 for a bread basket. then our orders arrived, the food was very tasty. my friend noted how tender her ribeye was. it came with arugula tossed in vinaigrette. roasted brussel sprouts had to be ordered as a side. i ordered chilean sea bass, which was also tasty, but *tiny*. it looked like an appetizer. i kid you not. the serving of fish was the size of 2 (peeled) grapefruit sections. the two pieces were stacked on top of 14 cup of spinach, on top of a formed serving of rice (which was supposed to be a shrimp rice cake--but i couldn't detect a hint of shrimp). needless to say, i left there still as hungry as i came. i wish the venue well. it is a lovely spot and i would never discourage anyone from patronizing it, but beware of the chilean sea bass as an entree. it's not enough for a typical adult.","metadata":{"source":"data/raw/reviews.csv","line":3608}}],["3608",{"pageContent":"docs|rating|timestamp: great choice\nfood is excellent\nnice

mostly, ensuring we had a true dining experience. their wine list is extensive as well as their house cocktails, ruth was also knowledgeable about them, we started with evian water and a bottle of cab we had never tasted - great recommendation\nmy partner is gluten free \"gf\" and the menu certainly accommodated that in addition to an array of non gf items. the soup, burrata, salad, and the tasmanian steak..it did truly melt in my mouth. ruth advised us to keep some room for \"dessert\" - the butterscotch dessert was the bomb, and we had two others, all ending with an \"al fogato\" and a special \"happy anniversary\" topper on our desserts.\nthe main dining area is \"roofless\" and the evening was perfect. there was a gentle breeze, and the patio heaters, reflecting pool and other

fresco lunch.\nhaving read some not so favourable reviews about the outside seating area i was somewhat apprehensive however, from the moment we arrived to the moment we left [and without being rushed off of our table] i cannot fault the experience in any way whatsoever.\nif you are a little surprised to find yourself seated in an outside car park which has been 'done up' to accommodate outside dining regulations at the moment, then you are mistaken. the outside area, in normal circumstances, is in fact a small in out access to the rear of the hotel and ballroom entrance. there is plenty of cover overhead, blankets on your seats as you arrive and if you wish, a hot water bottle to keep the elements from settling-in but, not required by all of us yesterday.\nthe food was excellent, as was the presentation and arrival time for any of the food drink to get to the table. there was a variety of diners, socially distanced from us, all of which seemed to be enjoying an equally pleasant afternoon's dining.\nthe pandemic and the now recent opening-up has meant that the hospitality industry has had to rethink how it can maximise its offerings and if this temporarily equates to a bit of an alternative al fresco seating area as is currently at the biltmore then, in my book, this is well thought out and without any complaint from six ladies who enjoy fine dining - we are used to eating out at the more established of establishments [when we have been able to] so we know good food service levels.\ntherefore, please visit the biltmore, it was a lovey occasion, food drink reasonably priced and given its kitchen host, a certain mr atherton, you know before you get there that you will not be disappointed! will definitely visit again even if only for a quick cocktail in one of the rather swanky looking bars lounge areas.\nthank you to the biltmore for a lovely afternoon

middle of the heat wave hitting 30c during the day. we asked if it was possible to get another room, to which the answer was that they get back to us. they never did. when at checkout we were asked how our stay was we mentioned the broken ac, and only then were we offered a refund, which doesn't really redeem 3 terrible nights. - on the first night kids were screaming and shouting in the above

10-course brunch. unfortunately, one person in our party had medical issues so she was only able to order a-la-carte. the waitress informed us that the other two could not possibly order the 10-course brunch. so, instead of us paying $70pp for the brunch, we ended up getting $12 & $16 meals. this doesn't make sense financially for the business.. and i left hungry.\ni would only recommend this

good, but most of the time regrettable. if you can grab a spot outside and catch the sunset and live music then that is what i'd recommend. don't feel like you're making a reservation for a better or different experience inside, not going to be the case. if you drink beer the craft beers on tap are the way to go. the mixed drinks seemed very \"weak\" as the kids say haha. inside everything is the same menu-wise, plastic cups, ketchup packets, the whole nine. sound deadening tiles would be useful i think. peep the floors inside too, they are sweet! expect $19 crab dip and wine in sippy cups..that would sum it up i think lol. the place is about as green as a landfill. again, post up outside, listen to the live music and just be thankful you have your health and a good

preferred breakfast slot was 10:00 a.m. only after questioning the breakfast chef on the third day about the dried out breakfast did i realise that it was necessary to inform reception five individual times of our preferred breakfast slot - crazy! on our last morning at breakfast there was a woman carrying out a very loud and disruptive zoom meeting in the small breakfast area where the only tables set for three were available. why was she not asked to move away from the dining area? i am aware that the hotels in ireland have not been open for very long following the covid lock-down. nevertheless westgrove hotel must realise that visitors (especially from abroad) expect better. my stay with my family at your hotel was very

identified another table and asked to sit there. this had to be checked. then is was deemed permissible!\nwe were still however in an area where the hotel guest came and went as this restaurant is within a hotel complex. we saw guests in robes walking by from the spa, a group of golfers with clubs walked past our table to return to their room and various other comings and goings. when they have a specific restaurant with empty tables this was all unnecessary and a bit weird!\nwe didnt get their best available table and my advice when booking here is to specify you want to eat in the

start with saying the food was very good, which is why this review gets 3 stars. my compliments to the kitchen staff. however, the service and ambiance were subpar. this restaurant is in the lobby of the canopy hotel. like, in a wide-open corner of the lobby, so it's more like a typical hotel bar than a restaurant, which we didn't know when booking. it has an outdoor patio, but no interesting views, just a street corner. after being seated on the patio we waited for 5+ minutes without service, until the hostess came back over to tell us \"sorry for the wait, your server is still in the bathroom\". ok..thanks..and gross. when waiter finally showed we ordered drinks and food at the same time and let him know we'd take the check whenever as we had a show nearby to catch in 45 minutes. we were still waiting on drinks 10+ minutes later when the waiter brought the appetizer and said \"oh, i thought someone else brought you your drinks from the bar, i'll go get them now.\" thanks. the waiter was overly casual and generally unmotivated. sign of the times i suppose, with good service difficult to find in the restaurant industry. we won't be going back to cobre kitchen, though if we find ourselves in the area again we may check out outrider rooftop lounge on the roof of the canopy hotel. we overheard guests having a cocktail on the patio of cobre kitchen while they waited for

steak houses to choose from. they all have unique ambience and cater to their own specific crowd.\nhowever from the moment you enter stk you get the sense of the crowd they cater to is tourist, bachelorettes and the single older guy crowd. be prepared to wait 40 to 60 minutes even with a reservation. we had a 6 o'clock reservation and were told to go to the bar. after 20 minutes my husband was fuming. after 30 minutes he was ready to leave. kenny the manager offered to buy us a drink at the bar which went a long way towards alleviating the situation. after 45 minutes we were told our table was finally ready.\nkeep in mind that the main dining room is very small. not many people can be seated at this restaurant. i'm not sure what they can do about this but it seems at the bar area is the main way that stk serves their patrons. we sat down and ordered drinks, a 10 ounce fillet and my husband requested a special short rib mac & cheese. after the waitress said it would be extra $30 we said fine. what got sent out was a mac & cheese with maybe two scant pieces of short rib on it. so unbelievably stingy. in addition, the fillet was not 10 ounces it looked much smaller.\nit was at this time that the general manager, german walked over. he literally saved the entire night. he spent time talking with us about our experience and wanted to make sure the food issues were addressed. german has worked at the wynn hotel amongst many other upscale places and as a result he brings an enormous amount of experience and sophistication to stk. he made sure a side plate of short what was sent over and a proper steak in addition. i feel that under germans guidance stk can become a more upscale scottdale

tucked under his chin. he had a mask on but it was down around his neck so he was breathing into the stack of glasses his customers would be drinking from. nasty. he apologized for leaving us for so long without water on a hot day and left the *empty* water glasses on our table to give out the remaining glasses to others. the server also looked unhappy and like he wished he could be anywhere else but at work. he came back about 5 mins later with water bottles for the tables in our area, again carrying several in such a way that he was breathing into the open bottles. he finally came back to take our order later, and we were seriously thinking about just leaving. we went ahead and ordered though, and asked the server to bring us some clean glasses, since the ones he had brought us had someone's lipstick on them. also nasty. the tables around us had umbrellas at this rooftop restaurant, but they had neglected to purchase bases for the umbrellas, so they flopped around every time the wind blew. one of them came within inches of my wife's head - i had to grab it in flight to stop it from hitting her. one of the other tables complained about the umbrella problem which caused the manager to come over. he told the gentlemen at that table that he was doing the best he could but there was nothing he could do about the lack of bases. he said \"you can either have the umbrellas or

temperature being taken or any contact details. the food was reasonable, the steak was good i have to say, but as our first restaurant meal in nearly two years, the final bill did resonate as an effort to claw back lost revenue from last year, a fish pie at 13.95 with no sides? my dad recommended bill's to us as our daughter is soon moving to lewes and it would have been a great introduction

eve??). we ordered drinks and it took another 10 minutes to get them. the waiter didn't take any time to set up the experience or explain the menu, just asked for our order. there were three courses with three to four choices on each course. he also told us we needed to order everything at once, which felt a bit rushed, but he said they would pace the courses. we selected a barley and roast beef soup and a swedish meatball plate for appetizers. both came out cold. the barley was undercooked and there was no seasoning at all. no salt and pepper on the table either. meatballs were bland as well. when asked if we enjoyed it, we said no and were offered another choice of the final option, a bruschetta, which was fine.\nthe entre was a petite filet for me and a lobster tail for my wife. they were both tasty and cooked well, but the portion was tiny. the filet was maybe 4 oz and the lobster was just a few bites. we were not asked if we wanted more wine when our glasses were empty, and

sleep with the heat. a night porter then came up to the room with two portable fans and asked us to plug it in to help with the heat. he went over and checked the radiator and acknowledged it was way too hot and said he would say it to his boss in the morning. i then went down to reception the following morning to try speak to the manager about it as we paid over 100 for a room that we couldn't sleep in but unfortunately the manager wasn't in. the receptionist was lovely to speak to and took all the details of the incident down and told me that the hotel manager would be in contact with me.

best and super friendly even though she was obviously very under pressure. i understand there's teething problems with places reopening after the lockdown but when paying a lot for a hotel, dinner and drinks (prices much higher than average dublin prices which are already high), you atleast expect the service to be good. the last straw for us was that our room was piping hot! so much warmer than it was outside even with the air con on the lowest. we told the woman at reception about the room when checking out and she took the price of parking off our room. given that we spent over 400e in the hotel for our one night stay we were just so so disappointed with the poor standard.","metadata":{"source":"data/raw/reviews.csv","line":8865}}],["8865",{"pageContent":"docs|rating|timestamp: we had a

attractive, although it has no toilet facilities of its own, so you have a long walk through the hotel lobby to the basement to use the toilets. the food itself was really lacking in flavour and the menu misleading, for instance my tuna tartare said it came with 'confit egg yolk' but it was just a raw egg yolk with some slimy egg white attached. everything was under-seasoned. it was nice to see one vegetable side option came with the set menu, but the main course itself was very small (just two lamb cutlets with no sauce or other food) so the main dish felt unfinisheduncoordinated. deserts were delicious however.\ni would go back for cocktails at the hotel lobby bar and fab service, but wouldn't eat at the restaurant again and certainly wouldn't risk ordering from the a la carte menu

lobby before being able to go upstairs, in the meantime they served warm rose in plastic cups. once we got upstairs, and waited some more, we were finally able to sit. it took them about 45 minutes to take our order and we didn't start eating our appetizer until past midnight.. mind you we were there for a 10:30pm reservation. the first course arrived about 30 minutes after the appetizers and at around 1:15am they brought the main course and the dessert at the same time and the check and had the audacity to say \"no rush.\" when they were already turning on the lights and making it apparent they wanted us to leave. the food was really good but kind of cold and small portions, we expected small for a \"quick\" pre-fixe nye dinner but not really cold.. a few servers and bussers didn't give a damn about their masks and neither did the bartenders, neither our proof of vaccination or id were requested at any moment so happy omicron to us, lol. furthermore, the rooftop looks nice in photos but it is actually quite a narrow strip in the back of the hotel, the drinks were dreadful and we were initially seated in a corner without views and we asked for another table with slightly better views.. so be mindful that even if you book this for the views you might not even get them. i've worked at restaurants all my life and we did many events and pre-fixes and they're usually pretty straight forward and easy to do if the team is organized, so the very lousy service was surprising. we ended up leaving at around 1:30am.. right after finishing our dessert and just about 3h past our reservation time. in total, we spent about 30 minutes eating and 2.5h waiting. we ended feeling exhausted by the whole waiting thing and drunk on the cheap wine and dreadful cocktails they served,

with \"chef\" even though other salads on the menu listed baby greens and were thus readily available. when \"chef\" becomes a celebrity and opens his destination restaurant he can be as much of a prima donna as he wants, but as long as he is working in a hotel restaurant in the suburbs he needs to be more accommodating.\nanother problem is that we wished to order wine but asked for some guidance on finding a choice compatible with our meals. the server said he would get the sommelier to help us, but when heshe never came to our table and we had already finished our starters i

time for lunch and second for dinner. i had a calamari starter followed by wild salmon with potatoes, broccoli and asparagus. all were very palatable, veggies were delightfully not overcooked. my choices were pretty safe so i cannot comment further. i ordered their baklava purely to check how authentic they were. it was delicious with just enough honey ( maybe a tad more for me ) and the filo pastry was light but again, could have been drenched more but i think this is a personal preference rather than the guideline. my partner ordered a \"chocolate sin\" which had no description whether it was a mousse, soufle or something else. it was something else. not too sure how i would describe this triangle cut thinnish looking slab of chocolate. tasting this i still wasn't sure what it was, cake it wasn't, cheesecake no, soufle it definitely was not. it was a thick flour less hardish slice of chocolate that had obviously been tempered with maybe eggs and cream or yogurt then poured to set. it stuck to the roof of my mouth, full on with chocolate but not in a good way for me. i'm sure chocky lovers will delight in this dessert but sadly not for me. the side of raspberries were needed to enhance the dish. overall this is a beautiful restaurant with delightful staff who are attentive especially marcus. the display of fresh fish, shellfish and veggies was very pretty. it is expensive but you are in a 5 star hotel complex. it is not 5 star fine dining but great for a good fish lunch or dinner ( by the way their 3 course lunch menu is just $38 which is marvellous ). our
